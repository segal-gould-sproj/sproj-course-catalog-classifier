# Course Catalog Classifier
### A part of my Senior Project
Using Scikit-learn to classify courses by department and predict the probabilties of potential future course descriptions.

The project will have three parts:
* Web-scraping course catalogs ✔️
* Better serving course catalogs (compared to the current site) **¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**
* Machine learning to predict future potential course catalogs

Although not an initial goal of the project, text classification was something I used on my [Moderation Project](https://github.com/segalgouldn/segal-gould-moderation) so I thought it would be interesting to try it again.

This project was partially inspired by [@sabo](https://github.com/sabo).
