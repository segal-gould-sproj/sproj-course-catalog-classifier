The course will pay particular attention to the ways in which architects have responded to, and participated in, formal and aesthetic developments in other arts, as well as the role of architecture in broader technological, economic, and social-political transformations. Covering many aspects of architecture from buildings, drawings, models, exhibitions, and schools, to historical and theoretical writings and manifestoes we will investigate a range of modernist practices, polemics, and institutions. The readings, both primary and secondary texts, have been selected both to provide an overview of the history of modern architecture and to offer a number of critical and historical approaches to evaluating its legacy.

Amsterdam emerged as a global power in the early seventeenth century, having replaced Antwerp as the northern European center of capital and trade. With the help of the extraordinarily successful East and West India companies, the Dutch began exploring and colonizing locations throughout the world, including lower Manhattan. Although the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam to the British in 1667, they maintained a vibrant presence in New York for decades, shaping the growing city as well as its environs (including the Hudson Valley) well into the nineteenth century. We will look at how images and objects produced in both contexts during this time shaped ideas about nationhood, citizenship, and early modern science, and consider how colonial relationships are forged through representation.

In this course, focused primarily on the early modern period, we\u2019ll study how images (paintings, drawings, and prints) and objects (primarily sculpture), practices central to the creation of images and objects, and visual technologies have shaped modes of seeing in the west from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries.

We will also look at art criticism alongside other forms of writing, including film and cultural criticism, and consider models such as those of the poet-critic and the artist-critic. Towards the end of the course we will look at the historical moment in which criticism became increasingly embroiled with theory. We will conclude by focusing on the current crisis of criticism. As the status of the public has changed we will ask how the role of criticism has transformed as well. Throughout the course we will ask the question, What can art criticism do?

In the class, we will think about sound, not as accessory to image, but as a unique, fruitful site for making meaning within the context of film and videomaking. We will consider how filmic sounds are different from images and music and pay particular attention to human voices as soundmakers. We will also investigate the complex relationship of sound to the real and imagined spaces they activate, how sound design suggests modes of time and tense, and we will consider the roles silence and music play in filmmaking. During the course of the semester these conversations will inform the making of our own timed-based media --with particular emphasis on sound design.

In the context of an international migration \u2018crisis,\u2019 and shifts in national immigration policy, we will look for local stories that interrogate this theme. Within the larger class project students will work individually and in pairs to research, film, organize and edit short scenes. Students will work together to combine these scenes into a cohesive larger piece. The course will explore documentary techniques for researching complex topics, expose students to a multi-staged production process, and help develop strong communication skills essential to collaborative filmmaking.  Assigned viewings include films like \"Who Is Dayani Cristal?\" (Silver, 2012), \"New Americans\" (James, 2004) \"Farmingville\" (Sandoval and Tambini, 2004), \"The Overnighters\" (Moss, 2014), and \"La Ciudad\" (Riker, 1998) This course is part of the Liberal Arts Consortium on Forced Migration, Displacement and Education initiative.

The filmmakers are most often (but not always) highly independent figures working away from the Hollywood system. The range moves from bold realism to a search for a continuity that mirrors the movement of interior consciousness. Largely the time period covered will be from the late fifties to the early seventies when there were a number of dynamic experiments in narrative, but we will also look at relatively contemporary work as well, including films by Bard faculty members. Films to be studied include those by Shirley Clarke, Michael Roemer, Adolfas Mekas, Curtis Harrington, Monte Hellman, Robert Frank, Yvonne Rainer, Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, David Lynch, Richard Linklater, Susan Seidelman, Jim Jarmusch and others.

Operas by Cavalli, Sacrati and Monteverdi\u2014and their production and reception\u2014far closer resemble today\u2019s Broadway musicals than contemporary opera does. The course offers a comparative study of one of the best known early baroque operas, Monteverdi\u2019s L\u2019incoronazione di Poppea (1642), and the new Broadway hit, Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Hamilton (2015). Both works are based on a historical narrative (one on the story of the eccentric ancient Roman emperor Nero, as described by Tacitus, the other on the American founding father, Alexander Hamilton, as described by historian Ron Chernow), both play with the conventions of the respective genres (Monteverdi with the standard operatic forms such as lament, lullaby, love duet, while Miranda pairs Broadway style with hip-hop), both use an elevated form of speech in the dialogues (one the recitative, the other rap), and both offer the audience an irresistible musico-dramatic experience.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights.

        "department": "music",
        "description": "Sonata form is the most pervasive collective achievement in European music, running from the early 18th century on and still influencing the way much music is written today. It was considered such a natural phenomenon that it was discussed as having been \"discovered,\" not merely invented by humans, yet in many ways it was an artificial formula that killed as much music as it enlivened. This analysis course will study sonata form in its glorious heyday, before it was officially labeled by A.B. Marx in 1828. We'll start with simple binary forms of Kuhnau and Sammartini, proceeding through works of C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Clementi, Mozart, Dussek, Beethoven, Hummel, and Schubert, with Schumann and Brahms as an epilogue. The course will be graded on two analysis papers and weekly analysis of sonatas and symphonies given in class. It fulfills a theory requirement for music majors and is intended for musicians who have had Theory 1 and 2 or the equivalent, but any interested and qualified student is welcome. Class size: 22",

        "department": "music",
        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 16",

        "department": "music",
        "description": "For thirty years postmodern has been a notoriously difficult term to apply in music with any consistency. The late theorist Jonathan Kramer, though, advanced a view that postmodern is less a musical attribute than a style of listening, and his posthumous book Postmodern Music, Postmodern Listening represents the most profound work available on the topic. This course will use that book as a text, and will explore issues such as, what does it mean when we mix different styles in a piece of music? How do we know when to listen ironically? Is surreal music possible? Can music reorder our sense of linear time? Is postmodern music inherently a critique of modernism, or a new historical period? We\u2019ll be listening critically, sometimes ironically, to works from Charles Ives and Carl Nielsen to John Cage to John Adams to George Rochberg to John Zorn and beyond, basically constructing a philosophical framework for justifying musical style choices in the 21st century. Coursework will include two research papers, additional readings, and plenty of class and Moodle discussion. Some prior acquaintance with musical analysis will prove helpful, and we will be reading musical scores in class, though compensatory skills in other areas might successfully substitute.

After two general introductory classes, the course surveys the most important genres that Bach cultivated. His sonatas, concertos, suites, organ works and cantatas will be compared with those of his fellow composers Corelli, Vivaldi, Handel, the French clavecinists and North-German organists. Vocal music will be the topic of three subsequent classes, then the focus will be put on more theoretical issues such as what kind of contrapuntal and formal mechanisms work beneath the surface of Bach\u2019s music. Questions of a more aesthetic nature will appear at the end the course: how Bach treated the texts he set to music, how and why he built up carefully designed sets and cycles from his works, and where to place him in the aesthetic landscape of the early 18th century.

Although catchy, the adage is utterly fallacious. As this course attempts to show, there was never agreement about the phenomenon of \"Rhythm\" in the whole of human history. Musical rhythm, like time, is more accurately considered a relativity -- notions of musical motion, pulse, and meter vary across locations, communities, and individuals. Indeed, musical time changes over the course of time itself. In a History of Rhythm, students will discover various definitions for \"The Beat,\" multiple meanings and practices that dictated \"good rhythm\" within various musical cultures. Weekly lectures focus on historical musical notation, pedagogical techniques, compositional trends, and performance practices. The class will also analyze musical manuscripts and first editions by Machaut, Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and others. An ability to read music is required.

Students who take this course will focus their time and energy developing one performative project centered around the exploration of technology and identity. Each individual will develop and investigate a performance project which will culminate in a final performance viewing for the class. As a group we will provide feedback on each other\u2019s ideas. We will create a social space where students will be able to explore our relationship to gender, history (personal and cultural), alter-ego, celebrity, social politics, and dream. Readings on and viewings of work could include Hito Steyerl, Laurie Anderson, Andy Warhol, Juliana Huxtable, Wu Tsang, Martha Rosler, Miranda July, Bruce Nauman, Tony Oursler, Hennessy Youngman, Cindy Sherman, K8 Hardy, Petra Cortright, Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch.

The students pursue assignments that focus their attention on issues such as value contrast, warm and cool contrast, creating tonality, understanding the expressive and structural possibilities of the materiality of paint, as well as how all of these elements factor in the composition of form and space. The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well. There are no prerequisites for this studio class.

Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves.

You will explore different ways of building spatial relationships and investigating the mystery of forms and the unidentified pockets of space that connect and surround them. We will discuss light and air, weight, gravity, speed and tensions while addressing problems of scale and the potential power and pressure of how mark-making possibilities by using different materials (charcoal, pencils, cut paper, black and white acrylic paint) to create harmony that resonates throughout the composition. Great drawings and paintings of the past will be looked at and discussed and the importance of drawing through the ages considered. On occasion students will work from reproductions of master works. There will be assignments and critiques usually toward the end of the session. Class time is reserved for hard work. Class size: 14",

We will base our discussions on primary and secondary texts and modes of performance from 2,500 years of world theater, starting with Aristotle and the Greek tragic playwrights and approaching the cutting edge of contemporary performance practice. We will ask questions about interpretation, ephemerality, and reenactment, investigate how great artists from across the centuries have controlled our experience of theatrical time and space, and examine such topics as the representation of reality on stage, the relationship between performance and audience, and the constantly evolving interplay of theater and democracy.

This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance.

We will also examine (through video, pictures and written descriptions) seminal productions of these plays and discuss how these directors might have read these texts.

        "department": "theater",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Photography Since the invention of photography, the photograph has always been an unstable document. Caught between then and now, here and there, the photograph slides between presence and absence attesting to a world beyond the present moment. Performance, on the other hand, is often thought of as pure presence \u2013 as an ephemeral medium that resides wholly in its enactment. This class will challenge both of these presumptions, inviting students to explore the history and theory of both performance and photography. Our study will begin with the history of photography, considering questions about the politics of representation and the display of the body. Moving to the 1960s and beyond we will then explore ways in which artist have intervened in this history of photography through performance, focusing on works by Louise Lawler, Dan Graham, Helio Oiticica, Lucy Lippard, Mark Morrisroe and Nan Goldin. We will conclude by looking at a number of contemporary projects that offer up the photograph itself as a performance, often staging powerful revisions of some of our more ingrained cultural assumptions about self and other. At the center of the mediums of both performance and photography lie fundamental uncertainties about the ontology of the body. As such, we will be particularly attuned to queer, feminist, trans, and critical race and ethnicity studies that open up new terrains for the usefulness of photography and performance. Students will give presentations and conduct writing assignments based on readings. We will also develop a collective photography and performance journal, to be presented in a series of conference days at the end of the semester. Class size: 16",

Using A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream as our primary source text we will unpack Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic strategies (such as juxtaposition, comic tropes and conventions, extremity, fantasy) and examine existing adaptations (films, poetry, graphic novels, plays, musicals, television.)

Our focus will be on the rich and fertile complexity, as well as the problematic features of Puritan belief and rhetoric as they find expression in Puritan writings. We will look at Pauline theology, Puritan plain style and metaphor, and the Puritan construction of the radically individual American self. Authors include notable Puritan divines, poets, historians and citizens, as well as later writers, among them Jonathan Edwards, Washington Irving, Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, Robert Lowell and Martin Luther King, Jr. Class size: 22",

We will also investigate the distinct aesthetic and formal characteristics that distinguish this literature, which will allow us to develop an understanding of \"postmodernism,\" \"confessionalism,\" \"Afrofuturism\" and \"The New Journalism,\" as well as the literary and existential values of irony, sincerity, and authenticity.

We will read English translations of representative works by major writers from three periods (1918-1949; 1949-1976; since 1976) such as Lu Xun, Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Shen Congwen, Lao She, Mao Dun, and Chang Eileen from the May Fourth Movement and the intellectual radicalization of the first half of the 20th century, and Mo Yan, Yu Hua, Can Xue, and Han Shaogong out of the Cultural Revolution and the liberalization of the post-Mao era. In addition, we will study works by authors from Taiwan and Hong Kong such as Pai Hsien-yung, Wang Wen-hsing, Li Ang, Li Yung-p\u2019ing, Chu T\u2019ien-wen, Xi Xi, and Shi Shu-ching. We will consider issues of language and genre, nationalism and literary tradition, colonialism, women\u2019s emancipation movement, the influence of Western literary modes such as realism and modernism on the inception of literary modernity in China, and the current state of critical approaches to the study of modern Chinese literature.

The struggle to create an imaginative literature by and about Jews is thus examined with respect to often conflicted literary approaches to questions of Jewish identity and history (including persistent anti-Semitism in the countries of the Diaspora and the catastrophe of the Holocaust). In the process we will discuss such notions as Jewish identity and stereotypes, questions of \"apartness\" and \"insideness,\" and explore literary genres such as the novel, the tale, the fable, the folktale and the joke in relation to traditional forms of Jewish storytelling, interpretation and prophecy. We will look as well at what it is that makes \"Jewish humor\" both Jewish and funny and consider the consequences of a particular author's decision to write in either Hebrew or Yiddish, or in a language such as Russian, German or English. We will discuss as well Jewish participation in literary modernism. Authors include Rabbi Nachman of Bratzslav, Isaac Leib Peretz, Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Babel, Franz Kafka, Bruno Schulz, Primo Levi, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, Grace Paley, Aharon Appelfeld, Leslie Epstein, and Angel Wagenstein.\" This course is part of the World Literature offering.\nClass size: 22",

In this seminar we will trace some of the Boom's antecedents, particularly in Miguel Cervantes' woeful knight and Jorge Luis Borges' intricate fictional mazes; examine its classics, from Carpentier, Cortazar, Donoso, Fuentes, Garcia Marquez and Vargas Llosa; and delve into the work of some of its irrepressible second generation -- seeking throughout to discover what might account for this brief efflorescence of bold literary experimentation.

        "description": "2 credits It is 2017. Why aren\u2019t there more women in leadership positions? According to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains\u2014most notably politics and business\u2014women continue to be under-represented at the top. Last year's Presidential race polarized the electorar around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard\u2019s other campuses, we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address. This course is open to all first-year students, but enrollment is limited. Class size: 20",

Among other topics, we will consider mass entertainment, the emperor system, the student movement and its failure, the birth of environmental awareness, changing dynamics of sex, gender, and family, \"Americanization,\" the mythos of the middle class, and the historical roots of contemporary Japanese society.

Through the reading of both the underground publications of \"samizdat\" and officially published texts of the first period; the post-modernist works written at the end of the twentieth century; and the literary texts of the last two decades, we will focus on the issues of narrative strategies adopted by individual writers, reassessment of Russian history, gender and sexuality, religion and spirituality, cultural and national identity. The course will also explore the changing relationship between Russian literature, the state, and society. Readings include: Venedikt Erofeev, Tatiana Tolstaia, Liudmila Petrushevskaia, Viktor Pelevin, Boris Akunin, The Presniakov Brothers, Ludmila Ulitskaia, Vladimir Sorokin, Andrei Volos, Eugene Vodolazkin, and Mikhail Shishkin.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights, Middle Eastern Studies Questions of migration, exile, and displacement have been central to the development of the (post)colonial Arabic literary tradition. Tayeb Salih\u2019s Seasons of Migration to the North, widely considered the most important Arabic novel of the last century, charts Mustafa Said\u2019s journey taking him further and further from Sudan, and the frustrations and impossibility of homecoming. While the effects of the expulsions of the 1948 Nakba (catastrophe) and the further displacement of the 1967 Naksa (setback) on the evolution of Arabic prose and poetry are widely recognized, questions surrounding labor, its precarity, and migrations are largely understudied. How for example, does the intersection of a booming oil economy with a displaced and transient workforce, reshape the cultural map of the region? Rather than treat the questions of labor and (forced) migration as separate, in this course we will look at them as intertwined and interdependent. By focusing on Arabic literary production from the second half of the 20th century, we will ask how such works produce a language and aesthetic of displacement and estrangement, one that is able to challenge the hegemony of national boundaries. Finally, we will consider how these literary texts, as well as their authors, travel and migrate to speak to different audiences and from new and shifting centers. Literary texts will be supplemented by theoretical and historical material and will be accompanied by mandatory film screenings. All readings will be in English. This course is part of the Liberal Arts Consortium on Forced Migration, Displacement and Education initiative. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Russian Emperors, serfs, merchants, and soldiers built St. Petersburg, but it was the writers who put it on the cultural map of the world. Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St.   Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.",

Its use of melodrama and the macabre often disguise the psychological, sexual, and emotional issues that are in fact more horrifying than the contents of a haunted house. The gothic novel in America has often confronted topics pertinent to American identity and history. In this course we will examine how many American authors used the gothic genre to actually engage with social, political and cultural concerns.

The premise of the course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination, even as it transforms our lives and experiences. We will examine a range of meanings of the word \"media,\" from journalism and news to entertainment to the Internet and social media. We will read key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Friedrich Kittler, Ariella Azoulay, and Marshall McLuhan), and examine a range of critical, literary, and artistic reflections on our mediated universe. We will also spend some hands-on time working with -- and not just on -- media, in order to assess our own positions not just as as users and consumers but also as producers of media.

And what can this effort to represent injustice, suffering, or resistance tell us about fiction and literature? This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N.

How has colonialism shaped our ideas of the novel? What is the relationship between theories of intention and the performance of gender? And how do questions of racial difference intersect with models of narrative voice?

The course will include explorations of women\u2019s writing across genres, representations of and by women in the poetry, fiction, and visual art of the period, and a rigorous interrogation and destabilization of the category of \"woman\" and the \"female body\" as historical and literary figures. Using methodologies drawn from feminist studies, queer studies, and disability studies, this course will ask the fundamental question: how or what does the word \"woman\" mean across the nineteenth- and early twentieth centuries? How might the category be useful or not for evaluating the aesthetic and ethical positions of texts, verbal and visual? And how are bodies relevant in thinking through these questions? Texts might include works by: Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, William Makepeace Thackeray, Harriet Martineau, Coventry Patmore, Robert Browning, the Pre-Raphaelite and Aestheticist painters, photographers, and poets, Michael Field (Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper), Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Ford Madox Ford, William Butler Yeats, and Radclyffe Hall.

Through a semester devoted to the close reading of Swann\u2019s Way and Time Regained in their entirety and several substantial key-excerpts taken from all the other volumes, we will try to understand the complex nature of Proust\u2019s masterpiece and, among other things, examine the ways in which it accounts for the temporality and new rhythms of modern life. We will also question the narrative and stylistic function of homosexuality, discuss the significance of the massive social disruption brought about by the Great War and investigate why the visual arts and music are seminal to the narration. Additional readings from Barthes, Beckett, Benjamin, Deleuze, de Man, Kristeva and L\u00e9vinas among many others. Taught in English. Class size: 22",

Why is it, we\u2019ll ask, that in these works, grand ideas are raised and discussed with great intensity, when the African is \u2018virtually absent,\u2019 because the author denies him/her the power of speech, or is physically present but not wholly as a full human being equal to the others? We will, along the way, explore topics such as colonialism, racism, and civilization, inquire into the construction of the African in the consciousness of these authors, and ask what \u2018contribution\u2019 if any has the continent made towards the \u2018manufacture\u2019 of these texts by Joseph Conrad, Evelyn Waugh, Joyce Cary, Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow, V.S.

        "department": "lit3courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies This course is centered around American literary texts produced between (roughly) 1865 and 1914, by a variety of writers seeking to convey the \"realities\" of American life and culture in this turbulent period. A conventional understanding of Realism has, for many years, been defined by the works of James, Howells, Twain, Crane, Dreiser, Wharton, and Chopin---a handful of writers whose influential and significant contributions to the aesthetic movement of Realism are uncontested, but whose positionality (especially as white, privileged, and, for the most part, male) severely limited their ability to record, shape, or criticize the diverse whole of \"real\" American life. Alongside works by these writers, then, we will also examine texts by writers of color, of varying ethnicities, and by greater numbers of women, in order to access and better understand the different realities they were striving to document and influence. Texts by Zitkala-Sa, Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. DuBois, James Weldon Johnson, and Sui Sin Far---whose contributions are now, finally, garnering attention as responsive to and constitutive of a larger Realist aesthetic---flesh out our shared reading list, enriching and complicating our encounters with American languages, stories, and forms. In addition to the course readings, students will work closely with essays in contemporary criticism to analyze how current scholars wrangle with problems of defining Realism and its offshoots, among them Naturalism and Regionalism. A variety of writing assignments will afford us the opportunity to consider how small groups of texts converse about Realism\u2019s major themes and preoccupations.

Emphasis will be on building and consolidating knowledge of Latin grammar, syntax, and morphology, and on developing reading fluency and an appreciation for Latin style. After reviewing and completing the material in the textbook, we will undertake a sustained close reading of selections from Book 1 of Livy\u2019s History of Rome, focusing on Romulus and Remus, Rome\u2019s early expansion, and on Lucretia and the populist expulsion of the tyrant Tarquinius Superbus. We will consider this text both as an example of Livy\u2019s famously rich Latin prose, and through the lens of its Roman context as an ideologically charged foundation myth. Class size: 15",

The Georgics, a didactic poem on agriculture that mixes myth and manual, also uses a rustic backdrop to explore political and philosophical themes. We will study Vergil\u2019s innovative reworking of Greek poetic traditions in these poems as well as their political and social commentary.\nClass size: 14",

This seminar critically examines how the classical tragedy of ancient Greece provides ways of thinking through fundamental political questions, and considers \u2018tragic thought\u2019 within political theory. We will examine ancient and modern works by (among others) Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Arendt. Through these we will consider how these plays and text pose fundamental political dilemmas: how can we uphold justice in uncontrollable, unpredictable circumstances? Is obeying the law more important than doing the right thing? Can a democratic order be founded without an initial act of violence? If popular entertainment truly shapes our political culture, should we therefore approve government censorship? Through these texts we will how classical tragedy gives us a form of political, ethical, and historical thinking that has been taken up by many political theorists. Our task in this class is to see how thinking tragically has been used to illuminate, and navigate, ethical and political conflicts; and to ask how such thinking might remain important today.Class size:20",

Although we will read several texts commonly included in the canon of the Querelle, this course is not meant to be a survey of this specific historical conflict, but rather a broader exploration of the roles played by the past, the present and the future in the creation and reception of works of literature in the French tradition. We will focus on several authorial oppositions (Corneille/Racine, Voltaire/Rousseau, Balzac/Flaubert, Sartre/Blanchot), oppositions which each time restate the place of literature on the temporal spectrum. Readings from Montaigne, Corneille, De Scud\u00e9ry, De S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Perrault, Cr\u00e9billon fils, Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, De Sta\u00ebl, Constant, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Huysmans, Sartre and Blanchot.

        "description": "\"One alone is always wrong; but with two involved, the truth begins,\" reads an aphorism by Friedrich Nietzsche. His criticism of the isolated genius thinker also proposes an alternative mode of thinking and writing: creative collaboration. The seminar will explore several instances of such creative collaborations, e.g. Friedrich Nietzsche and Lou Andreas Salome, the latter and Rainer Maria Rilke, Hannah Arendt and several poet friends of different languages, Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann, Oskar Pastior and Nobel Prize Winner Herta M\u00fcller. These intellectual relationships are also documented in letter exchanges, so that our seminar will unfold the word \"correspondence\" in a literal and in a figurative way. In this sense, \"Correspondence\" exceeds the limits of a single literary text or a letter; its dynamics translates into poems, novels, essays, or theoretical writings. As a consequence, fundamental categories such as authorship, work, intertextuality, or addressing are called into question. Our seminar will continuously reflect upon those terms based on canonical writings of modern literary criticism, including Benjamin, and (to be read in English) Genette, Barthes, L\u00e9vinas, Derrida.

The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi). It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust (Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy). Finally, it surveys the persistence of gender and racial exclusions after the establishment of a new democracy. Prerequisites: Italian 202 or permission of instructor. Conducted in Italian.

The course will also explore the changing relationship between Russian literature, the state, and society. Readings include: Venedikt Erofeev, Tatiana Tolstaia, Liudmila Petrushevskaia, Viktor Pelevin, Boris Akunin, The Presniakov Brothers, Ludmila Ulitskaia, Vladimir Sorokin, Andrei Volos, Eugene Vodolazkin, and Mikhail Shishkin.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Russian Emperors, serfs, merchants, and soldiers built St. Petersburg, but it was the writers who put it on the cultural map of the world. Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St.   Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.",

A discussion of all matters editorial will be our priority. We will study Nabokov\u2019s correspondence with Katharine White and William Maxwell, his editors at The New Yorker, and look at the drafts of his stories, now part of the Berg Collection in the NYPL.

        "description": "Federico Garcia Lorca is Spain\u2019s most well-known and widely read poet and playwright of the 20th Century. It is perhaps in part due to this well-deserved fame that he has traditionally been considered as the quintessential Spanish contemporary writer. His works are virtually untranslatable and hermetically personal, and yet continue to draw the spellbound interest of a loyal readership all around the globe. In this course we will study Lorca\u2019s poetry and drama closely \u2013 from his early classicist texts to his late avant-garde production, including his famous folklorist Gipsy Ballads, his surrealist Poet in New York, and plays like Blood Wedding or The House of Bernarda Alba. We will do so in the context of Spain\u2019s cultural and political life, in the years leading up to Lorca\u2019s assassination during the early days of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) as well as in the posthumous context of his afterlives. We will pay particular attention to how the reception of his eventful life and his writing, both in Spain and abroad, has contributed to build the monumental figure of a national poet and even a martyr. Throughout the course, we will also lend an equally attentive ear to those traits that seem foreign, strange and discordant in this well-rounded figure, with the idea of reaching a better understanding of the tragic element that may still propel Lorca\u2019s ghostly afterlife beyond the narrow boundaries of the Spanish historical context.

By altering perceptions of space and time, rethinking the limits of language, and exploring the inner world of the subject and the unconscious, authors such as Vicente Huidobro (Chile), C\u00e9sar Vallejo, C\u00e9sar Moro (Peru), Adolfo Bioy\nCasares, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejandra Pizarnik (Argentina), Carlos Fuentes (M\u00e9xico), Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (Colombia), and Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay) experiment with new forms of representation that garner universal appeal. We will consider the influence of important Latin American literary avant-garde movements, such as \"creacionismo,\" ultraism, and surrealism, and will cover topics such as magical realism, \"lo fant\u00e1stico,\" and \"lo absurdo\" to understand these new and original ways of redefining \"the real.\" In order to offer greater exposure to important Latin American literary works, the course will also provide a selection of poems, essays and short stories from authors such as Carlos Oquendo de Amat, Blanca Varela, Oliverio\nGirondo, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Octavio Paz.

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior.

The versatility of these methods is discussed, using novel ways to apply these reactions to generate elusive structures. Variations in reactivity are discussed to illustrate the differential reactivity of similar functional groups and how these differences may be used in selectivity. Fairly complicated syntheses are evaluated to appreciate new ideas and approaches to synthesis.

We will start with a survey of the most compelling lines of evidence for climate change, how they are obtained/derived and some of their limitations. We will then discuss in some depth idealized one-dimensional planetary radiative and thermal balance, first in the absence of an atmosphere, and then in the presence of a radiatively active one, with variable number of layers. In this context, it will become interesting to explore atmospheric opacity with respect to various radiative types, and what natural and anthropogenic effects affect this opacity. A related topic will be natural feedbacks, such as water vapor and could feedbacks. We will next place current (modern) observations of climate change in the broader context of past climates, emphasizing the last couple millennia,hundreds of millennia, and finally the ten million-year scale geological record. We will conclude the course with some discussion about the objective of successful policy mitigation efforts, and their implementation obstacles. While not technical per se, participation in this course does require the ability to solve a couple of linear algebraic equations (like solving x + 4 = 2y and 2x - 3y = 6 for x and y) and to perform some very basic manipulation of data and plot the results (using, e.g., Microsoft's Excel).

These are traced from the speculations within the Ancient World to current scientific thinking and methods guiding the study of psychology and other social science disciplines. Importantly, because a discipline is also about people who advance it, students are introduced to the lives and times and ideas of individuals who have made significant contributions to the field. Particular attention is given to such figures as James, Pavlov, Freud, Skinner and Asch, to mention just a few. Illumination will also come from a consideration of correspondence between and among pivotal individuals in the field. Critical analyses and integrations are juxtaposed with historical renderings. Upper college students likely will benefit from this course because they already possess the foundational knowledge necessary to draw comparisons and critically evaluate varying points of view. Lower college students likely will use the course to greet the intellectual domains they enter. Class size: 22",

It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project).

We ask how artifacts of mundane daily life and ritual materials were left in juxtaposition. At the Forest site, toward the Hudson River along an old carriage path behind Admissions, chipped stone objects afford the most conspicuous evidence of activity 5,000 years ago. Our focus, however, will be on the distribution of fragmentary ceramic vessels and whether they were made from clay found beneath a nearby waterfall. From the soil of fire pits on the adjacent promontory may emerge vestiges of plants and animals with which people interacted. Basic excavation techniques combine with microscopy and cartographic analyses to situate our discoveries in the living space. Our interpretive perspectives range in scale from miniscule wear patterns to the central Hudson Valley and beyond, to the ancient coastal Northeast. We will perform replicative experiments to make and use stone tools. Weekly writings on various studies will receive discussion in seminar. By interview with professor. Another way to prepare for this course is the Field School this summer that likely will encounter ancient artifacts through similar techniques of excavation and contextualization; for info, go to http://www.bard.edu/archaeology.

This course begins with an investigation of the Anthropocene\u2019s theoretical origins, and how this framework reorients our basic assumptions in relation to nature and the physical world. How are the effects and implications of the Anthropocene calculated and interpreted in public discourse and policy? How has the idea given rise to alternative theories, such as the Capitalocene or Chthulucene, to complicate its original premise? Should we seek to preserve earth\u2019s systems in their \u2018natural state,\u2019 or embrace the idea of actively managing socio-natural landscapes? To explore these questions, we will turn to case studies based in Asia, a region assumed to hold much of the world\u2019s environmental future in its hands. By looking at how communities, movements, states, and institutions articulate new moral and political imperatives in response to the crisis, we will consider the Anthropocene as a productive force that entails a playful reimagining and remaking of human engagements with the environment. Specific topics will include green building and greenhouse gas emission reduction in South Korea, urban agriculture and post-3.11 food movements in Japan, giant panda conservation and changing meanings of wildlife in China, and wind farms and alternative energy in the Philippines.

In pre-history the eastern branch of the RiftValley was the site of theemergence of the humanspecies.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights; Middle Eastern Studies How does the state as a modern political form shape culture, and vice versa? Why do groups (e.g. queer, indigenous, religious, ethnic) seek recognition from this thing we call the state while at the same time mocking, being suspicious or fearful of it? Like many groups, scholarship about the modern state tends to be shot through with \"state phobia.\" However, the most recent elections in the United States are challenging suspicions of the state as a set of institutions among many of the regime's critics. Anthropological analysis of the state could not be more urgent. The first half of this course explores how scholars define the modern state and how they critique its effects on societies and cultures in the twentieth century. We begin with foundational theories of the state (e.g. Weber, Hall, Althusser, Foucault, and Bourdieu). Due to his major influence on anthropological work on neoliberalism, immigration, bureaucracy, state healthcare and social welfare, we place special emphasis on how Michel Foucault conceptualized the modern state and his critique of its attendant modes of power (e.g. discipline, governmentality, biopolitics). During the second half of the course we read ethnographies of the state in the United States, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, Togo, Gaza, France, Cameroon, India, Egypt, Turkey and Germany. We investigate the unlikely relationships between phenomena such as corruption, borders, railroads, time, insanity, sexuality, warrior honeybees and science, on the one hand, and the effects, and meanings, of statehood and state-making in the modern world, on the other. How do institutions, practices and people come to appear like a state in the first place? We conclude with an examination of a question inspired by the recent political mobilizations of the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. In what ways does it make sense -and in what ways does it not-to call the U.S. a \"police state\"? Class size: 22",

This course begins with the assumption that language and culture are inseparable, and will introduce students to theoretical and ethnographic approaches that demonstrate this connection in different ways. The course will include close analysis of everyday conversations as well as social analysis of broader discourses related to class, gender, and nationality in written and oral narratives. Some of the topics we will discuss include: how authority is established through specific forms of speech, the performative power of language, the relationship between language and social hierarchies, the study of discourse as historical and social forms. We will also examine the way technology and technological metaphors in language have been fundamental in shaping the way different cultures perceive their social worlds. Students will be required to do their own cultural analysis of a conversation, a written or oral narrative, and discourse on the web or other media using the conceptual tools we develop through the course.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights Since 2015, more than two million people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries have travelled to Europe, typically without state authorization, to seek asylum and refuge. This course examines the arrival of these refugees and the varied ways their presence has come to be viewed as a \"crisis.\" Drawing on recent ethnographic research and anthropological theorizing, we shall consider the discourses and practices that shape how people in the Middle East and Africa seek to cross European borders. We shall investigate the innovations in surveillance, security, and bureaucratic management that the EU and its member states have employed to prevent and regulate refugees' entry. We shall explore the techniques with which state agencies have sought both to govern and to care for refugees after their arrival in European nation-states. And we shall critically engage with the populist rhetoric and violence that have targeted refugees as threats to national and European integrity. Throughout the course, our readings and discussions will reflect on the epistemology and politics of \"crisis.\" Is the declaration of a crisis a neutral act that announces a break from \"the normal\" in a self-evident, objective way? Or is it instead an ideologically charged claim that varied actors may employ to mobilize public fears, desires, and resentments and to promote particular visions of the nation, citizenship, and state obligation?

How are systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice formulated and expressed across time and space? What are the distinctive methods of structural functionalism, processual analysis, interpretive anthropology, and political economy for the study of religious systems? Our primary focus will be on non-Western conceptual systems and religions, and will include \"primitive rationality,\" the interpretation of myth, magic and systems of classification (such as totem and taboo), and the analysis of ritual and religious practice and practitioners, to include witchcraft, rites of passage, spirit possession, and prophetic and revitalization movements. In particular, we will study power and resistance, the rhetoric of persuasion, political spectacle and charisma, and religious fundamentalism and their expressions in the contemporary world. Readings will draw from theorists such as Durkheim, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Douglas, Turner, and Geertz among other classical and contemporary theorists. Our primary focus is on the religions and syncretistic religious expressions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, as well as on local variants of world traditions such as Christianity.

It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

Photographs of two-headed Iraqi babies circulate with captions about their mothers' exposure to unidentified toxic chemicals following the U.S. led invasion of Iraq. Widespread calls to close Indian Point Nuclear facility, 1.5 hours south of Bard, by 2021, remind us that we live exposed to nuclear leakage, usually without knowing it. These moments raise questions about the production of expert knowledge and the forms of evidence that count in claims-making about exposure to toxic materials. Toxicity and contamination are generally thought of as corrosive, damaging and destructive of human health and natural environments. But they are also generative. This seminar investigates what they make possible-and thinkable-by exploring controversies around exposure to toxicity and contamination from Hiroshima to Flint. We will begin by reading about nineteenth and early twentieth century American and European ideas about contamination \"at home\" and in the colonies. The course will then consider ethnographic case studies from Japan, the United States, Ukraine, Iraq, Palestine and India. Discussions will consider questions including: How do knowledge about toxicity and distributed risks of contamination transform cultural life? What is the relationship between environments, bodies and bodies of knowledge? How are the boundaries of the self, of communities and ideas about ethics, rights and duties renegotiated through adjudication of exposure? How have nuclear disasters changed the meanings of biological risk, biosecurity and governmental uncertainty? What is the relationship between toxicity and political authority? What forms of agency (human and non-human) emerge and conflict around contamination controversies? When contamination is invisible to the naked eye and undetectable by other senses, how is it made perceptible and what new forms of epistemology does that engender? What are the different temporalities of contamination and how do they contribute to a politics of uncertainty? How are certain spaces-whole cities, regions, workplaces, infrastructures-produced as toxic and dangerous? Class size: 15",

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

In this course, we attempt to achieve the following three objectives: (1) Understand all the concepts covered in Introduction to Microeconomics in terms of mathematics; (2) Study advanced topics such as choice under uncertainty and information asymmetry that have traditionally relied on mathematics for illustration of ideas; and (3) Learn how to use mathematics to conduct in-depth economic analysis. In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class. A firm grasp of the materials covered in this course is essential to reading economics journal articles and pursuing advanced studies in economics. Prerequisites: Calculus I and ECON 100.

We then focus our attention on investigating economic theories that explain short run business cycles, the periods of recessions and booms that occur on a regular basis. An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries. We apply the acquired theoretical knowledge to a range of current economic issues, including budget deficits and national debt, international trade, and the role of institutions.

We will cover theories of the production, supply and demand for health and health care services with special emphasis on the theoretical implications for policy, particularly in the United States. We will approach the determinants and policy implications of health and health care services through neoclassical as well as heterodox schools of economic thought. As such, students will develop an understanding of the politics, social context and production of health and well-being. The course endeavors not to provide students with a set of 'facts' regarding systems of health provisioning in different contexts. Rather, the course will equip students with the analytical tools necessary for continued intellectual engagement in research and debates surrounding the economics of health. Students will study competing perspectives on the ability of markets to efficiently provision health care services. Further, we will cover economic theories related to health, such as the economics of information, in addition to institutional approaches that highlight the role of history and politics. As such, we will pay special attention to the historical development of health care services in the U.S. to provide an institutional account of the economic, historical and political aspects involved with the current health services market. The course will pay special emphasis to the application of the analytical tools developed in class to current trends and debates in the U.S. For example, we will critically investigate the widespread use of cost-benefit analysis in the implementation of federal rules and policies addressing public health. We will also discuss trends in healthcare expenditures, cost control mechanisms, healthcare reform proposals as well as issues of equity and ethics in access to (and delivery of) health care.

We then compare the trajectories of economic change during the twentieth century. Particular attention is paid to the various economic models pursued in the region, including the colonial export economy of Southeast Asia, export-oriented industrialization in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, import-substituting industrialization in India, and the communist economy of Mao\u2019s China and mainland Southeast Asia.

Each week, we will pose a question based on an issue of current interest (e.g. Does free trade contribute to widening the gap between the rich and the poor? Why does the US import Chevy cars from Canada? Should the US ban clothing imports from sweatshops in Bangladesh? Should Apple move the production of iPads from China to the US? Did NAFTA contribute to an increase in illegal immigration?) and develop theoretical tools that help us answer it.

More and more income goes to capital-owners and profits, not workers and labor, and since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1%. There is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, and the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This course surveys landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and is research-based through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. A substantial component of the course involves data procurement and analysis and in-class work on laptops. We focus on the United States and provide international comparisons.

After her death, her successors continued this task. Additionally, the creation and development of Montgomery Place mirrored contemporary social relations and cultural conventions, along with shifts in these realities at the national level. As it was populated by indentured servants, tenants, slaves, free workers, and elites, Montgomery Place will be approached as a historical laboratory for understanding social hierarchies, social roles, cultural practices, and the evolving visions of the nation and \"place\" that both sustained and challenged these things during the nineteenth century in the United States.

Yet the reality of American history belies this myth. The nation\u2019s history is transnational and yet we focus mostly on its Anglophone roots, ignoring that the \"U.S.\" was carved out of the contests of many empires and grew on internationally based forced labor regimes. It is a story of individuals, alone and/or together, contesting, reacting towards, rejecting, influencing, and embracing the changing notions of what \"the United States\" and \"America\" were from the sixteenth century well into the nineteenth century. The course focuses on six moments that definitively challenged and shaped conceptions of \"American identity\", \"citizen\", and \"the United   States\": the early colonial period, the Constitutional Convention, Cherokee Removal, the era of the internal slave trade and the \"Market Revolution\", the Mexican-American War, and Reconstruction.

The rise of the French intellectual, the reformulation of gender roles, the invention of race, and revolution and resistance in overseas territories contributed somehow to give France the most strongly articulated modern identity in Europe. First year students are encouraged. Class size: 20",

Our focus will be bubonic plague, which was epidemic throughout the Mediterranean and European worlds for four hundred years, and which remains a risk in many parts of the world (including the southwestern United States) to this day. Topics include: a natural history of plague; impact of plague on mortality and socio-economic structures; effects on art and literature; early epidemiology and public health; explanations and cures; the contemporary presence of bubonic plague and fears about \"new plagues.\" Readings include: literary works by Camus, Boccaccio, Manzoni, and Defoe; historical and philosophical analyses by ancients Thucydides and Lucretius; contemporary literature on history, biology, and public health.

In turn, the image and its archiving were critical facets of the continent\u2019s histories of liberation and post-independence. This survey introduces students to the historical development of photography in Africa and the historical uses of photographs in the late-nineteenth century to recent times. Divided into five parts, the course begins with different theoretical views on the relationship between photography and history. After a consideration of the photography of the royal courts in North Africa and Christian missionaries in West Africa, the class will shift to the role of photography in the making of independent African nations and their liberation struggles during and after World War II. The course concludes by considering the commodization of African photography at international biennales and its functions for single-party regimes that continue to rule across Sub-Saharan Africa. Key themes include photography\u2019s role in shaping historical knowledge and the representation of Africa and its peoples, the appropriation of image making into African creative practices and daily life, the politics of exhibition and archiving, and the ethics of seeing war and social justice. Students will design a historical photography exhibition, and, over the course of the semester, they will also have the opportunity to interact with leading photography curators, photojournalists and art photographers who have spent time in Africa.

It is a more comprehensive mode of organizing society that is being continuously adopted, modified and subverted around the globe. In this course, we will explore the multiple, and often counter-intuitive ways, in which capitalism became entrenched in the modern Middle East. Drawing on social, intellectual, environmental and business histories, we will examine how the encounter with modern capitalism shaped such pervasive political phenomena as European imperialism, post-colonial nationalism, and contemporary sectarianism. Additionally, we will dissect common modern practices, like smuggling and consumerism, to uncover how they came to define the culture of capitalism in Middle East over the past two centuries. Finally, we will consider the paradoxical place of the Middle East within the current global (capitalist) order, being at once a major exporter of oil and financial capital that power the world's most advanced economies, and a major exporter of economic migrants and refugees.

Refugee Resettlement. These words - usually confined to policy, enforcement, and activism related to migrants and refugees - have recently exploded into the public view and entered into constant use. The current political administration made migratory and refugee enforcement, and of migration more generally, a centerpiece of its electoral campaign and the subject of its first executive orders, generating broad public controversy. Most migration to the US is from Latin America, by far the largest single migrant population is from Mexico, and the rise of Central American migration has proved enduring. Focusing on south-north migration from these Latin American regions, this class argues that it is impossible to understand the current political situation in the US without studying the relatively lesser-known history of migrant and refugee human rights over the last three decades, including massive protests, movements for sanctuary, and attempts at reform and enforcement. The class takes into account shifting global demographics, changing reasons for migration, rapid legal and political changes, complex enforcement policies and practices, and powerful community movements for reform, which are often forgotten with the opening and closing of a given news cycle. The class also argues that migrant and refugee voices matter and are critical to understanding migration as an historical and current problem. The course includes migrant, refugee, and activist narratives, and an array of historical, legal, political, and other primary sources. Its goal is to create a more complete historical understanding of Latin American-origin migration in the contemporary US context.

Our point of departure will be traditional areas of focus for scholars of gender and sexuality in China: footbinding, the cloistering of women, and the masculinization of public space; the transformations of Confucian age-sex hierarchies within the family; the women\u2019s rights movements of the early twentieth century; and the Chinese Communist revolution\u2019s ambivalent legacy for women in the People\u2019s Republic of China. By drawing on recent historical and anthropological literature, we will also analyze gender\u2019s functions in many other aspects of modern Chinese life. These topics will include constructions of masculinity and male identity during China\u2019s late imperial period (1368-1911), the role of gender categories in constructions of Han Chinese relations with both Inner Asian nomadic peoples and Euro-American imperialists, the gendering of citizenship and comradeship in twentieth century China, the impact of global capitalism on gender constructions and sexual relations in contemporary China, and the relation of China\u2019s women\u2019s movement to recent trends in Euro-American feminism and gender studies.

Colonial America existed in a constant state of war. This course is a close study of formal and informal military conflicts from the 16th to the early 19th centuries, looking at well-known engagements such as the so-called \"French and Indian War\" and lesser known episodes, like the French and Abenaki raid on Deerfield in 1704. Students will learn how European and indigenous American rules of violence developed, shifted, and adapted in response to the Columbian Exchange, and how war came to shape contemporary American identity. In addition to primary sources, we will consider literary, cinematic, and live reenactment interpretations of colonial conflicts and consider what these tell us about the relationships of history and memory.

Through a mix of theoretical and historical texts, we will consider how print media have fostered the development of new political communities like the nation state, generated publics and counter-publics, both created and undermined cultural authority, enabled new dynamics of knowledge production, and facilitated development of new modes of reading and interiority. Our inquiry will be global in scope, encompassing not only the Gutenberg revolution in Europe but also the diverse forms of print culture and print capitalism that developed contemporaneously in the Middle East, South Asia, and East  Asia. Analysis of the recent rise of digital media will provide critical perspective for understanding how the materiality of the printed text and its circulation through space has affected its social, cultural, and political significance. Ten weeks of the course will be dedicated to shared readings and discussion.

Historians are perplexed because Africa\u2019s independence and decolonization were supposed to bring peace and prosperity, and henceforth scholarship reflected this desire and promise. This seminar challenges students to move beyond the rhetoric of political conflict in Africa that extends from realities of failed states and underdevelopment and instead understand these current struggles as crises of historiography. In short, what does a contemporary history of Africa look like with the concept of civil war? Course participants will seek to understand the ongoing conflict in Central  African Republic and South Sudan within a larger historical context of civil war in post-independent Africa. Through shared readings and discussions, students will use primary and secondary sources to consider possible causes for civil unrest in Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone, the actors and interests involved, proposed resolutions, and their immediate and long-term effects. By tracing a historiography of civil war in African historical and political discourse and by analyzing possible methodological complications, students will grapple with how real world experiences and acts of violence translate into historical narratives, the very politics of historical revisionism. Students will be required to develop and carry out an independent research project of their choosing. Class size: 15",

After brief consideration of the origins of history as a formal academic discipline in the 19th Century, and of the transition from political to social history in the mid-twentieth century, we also consider the shift from social history to the multiplicity of approaches that came out of the \"theory explosion\" between the 1960s and early 2000s. This course draws from the fields of modern European, African, and World History. Course readings shall consist mostly (but not entirely) of historical writing about the Great War from a variety of historiographical points of view. Readings also include a wide range of primary materials. Conventional teaching on WWI tends to follow the diplomatic history approach, and to emphasize the war on the western front. To enlarge this view, we will read not only from the classic \"causes of WWI\" literature, but also from gender, cultural, and post\u00ad colonial treatments of the war, and read about the impact of the war on the eastern front, on China, in Africa. Working with this diversity of texts gives us the opportunity explicitly to discuss how different historiographical approaches change how we understand \"what happened.\" This course satisfies the historiography requirement for Historical Studies concentrators; it may also serve as a Major Conference if arranged with the instructor.

Yet the foundation, function, and limits of human rights remain deeply puzzling and highly contested- perhaps more so today than any time in recent history. What are human rights and what is their source? What is the relationship between human rights and human nature, human rights and morality, human rights and law, human rights and freedom? Can any human right truly be universal? In this course, we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring the philosophical underpinnings, justifications, and criticisms of human rights.

Feminist ethics thus redresses some blindspots of traditional moral theory, and develops its own positive concepts of ethical agency, moral responsibility, and how to live well. In this introductory course we will map the unique contributions of feminist ethics, with special attention to issues of gendered embodiment, difference, sexuality, care, and power as they impact ethical theory and practice.

In this seminar we will study the Ethics with special attention paid to Spinoza's ethical theory.

This distinction is important as areas with a legacy of epistemological colonialism, like the Caribbean, have many works that contain a substratum of philosophical ideas but have not necessarily been welcomed as canonical works of philosophy. Thus we will seek to engage in philosophy as a questioning activity that attempts to answer epistemic, aesthetic, normative and metaphysical questions. Some threads of analysis unique to this geography that this course will cover, include: the idea that philosophy is a contextual project rooted in a specific place rather than an abstract, ideal theory; the effect of colonialism on culture and education; the exploration of creolization; and the critical analysis of \"modernity\" as a European project. Course texts include works by Edouard Glissant, Wilson Harris, Eugenio Maria Hostos, Julia de Burgos and Franz Fanon.Class size:15",

From there we will move to Hume's essay on taste, looking into the distinction between subjective and objective judgement and the nature of aesthetic perception. We will then progress to a close reading of Kant's Critique of Judgement, in which we will explore questions of aesthetic perception, judgement, ethics and aesthetics, the beautiful, and the sublime. We will end with an examination of the transition to the aesthetics of romanticism and nineteenth-century aesthetic thought. This course satisfies the Junior Seminar requirement. Class size: 15",

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Indigent defendants are falsely convicted, and even executed for crimes they did not commit. We say that law is the institutional embodiment of justice. And yet, it is equally true that law, as it is practiced, seems to have little connection to justice. As the novelist William Gaddis writes: \"Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.\" This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty to obey the law? Is it possible for law to do justice? Through readings of legal cases as well as political, literary, and philosophical texts, we seek to understand the problem of administering justice as it emerges in the context of contemporary legal institutions. Texts will includeImmanuel Kant,Groundwork of a Metaphysic of Morals,Herman Melville,Billy Budd, andselections from Dostoevsky, Twain, Melville, Plato, Blackstone, Holmes, Milton, Kant, and others.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (GIS core course); Human Rights What does it mean to be a global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.This course will be taught concurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions. ",

Much of the emphasis is on the evolution of democracy across the region, including examining such questions as why it has taken so long for democracy to take root in Latin America, at least in contrast to the United States and Western Europe, and why does the quality of democracy varies so greatly across the region. Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa  Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 18",

This seminar critically examines how the classical tragedy of ancient Greece provides ways of thinking through fundamental political questions, and considers \u2018tragic thought\u2019 within political theory. We will examine ancient and modern works by (among others) Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Arendt. Through these we will consider how these plays and text pose fundamental political dilemmas: how can we uphold justice in uncontrollable, unpredictable circumstances? Is obeying the law more important than doing the right thing? Can a democratic order be founded without an initial act of violence? If popular entertainment truly shapes our political culture, should we therefore approve government censorship? Through these texts we will how classical tragedy gives us a form of political, ethical, and historical thinking that has been taken up by many political theorists. Our task in this class is to see how thinking tragically has been used to illuminate, and navigate, ethical and political conflicts; and to ask how such thinking might remain important today.Class size:20",

These questions have preoccupied political theorists since ancient times. In recent years, they have also taken on urgency as democracy has become conflated with individual liberty and the free market. This class introduces students to the study of democratic theory. We will examine classical accounts of democracy by canonical political theorists. We will also focus on the way American and European radicals-especially socialists, feminists, and black nationalists-redefined its scope, transforming democracy into a fighting creed for greater political inclusion, participatory citizenship, and economic equality. Our goal is understand the rich, conflictual history of the concept, the better to understand what \"the rule of the people\" ought to mean today.

        "description": "Cross-listed:Global & International Studies; Russian & Eurasian StudiesIn the 1980-90s, Soviet and Russian society underwent catastrophic turmoil, simultaneously experiencing a democratic revolution, the dissolution of an empire, and societal collapse. The end of the communist project in Russia did not lead to a standard normalizing \"transition\" to a liberal democracy, but produced instead a dramatic chain of events. An attempt at neoliberal economic reform coincided with a deep economic crisis, a reclamation of power by former communist officials, and a tendency toward a social anomie. The result, politically, was a gradual construction of an authoritarian regime and the formation of a political culture that is obsessed with a \"geo-political\" competition with \"West\" and sharply polarized between the conservative and liberal sensibilities. Why did the Soviet Union collapse? Why did the democratic revolution fail? Why has the most \"left-wing\" country in the world become one of the most \"right-wing\" countries in the world? Why have nationalism and imperialism reemerged in a time of globalization? Why does contemporary authoritarianism use elections, courts, and sociological surveys as its indispensable instruments of governance? The course will explore these and other questions in relying on the readings in political science, history, sociology, and cultural studies, as well as film and literary fiction.Class size:22",

Beyond the headlines, however, there are developing trends, emerging actors and competing explanations that are often overlooked. This course examines the international politics in MENA using the theoretical tools of international relations. Major themes include the nature of the state system in the MENA and its creation; the causes of conflict within the region; the roles played by outside powers; and the causes and effects of transnational forces such as Arab nationalism, Islamic radicalism, criminal networks, media and global economic actors. The course will also explore the nature of sub-state and sectarian identities and the effects on regional politics (ie, Sunni vs Shi\u2019i Islam, Kurds, Amazigh. These themes are explored in the context of several case studies, including, but not limited to, the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, the wars in Iraq, the revolution in Libya, and the ongoing crisis in Syria. The course will offer students a better understanding of the international politics of the MENA and will help students appreciate the competing pressures on policymakers as the region changes in rapid and complex ways.  The course will also highlight ways in which international relations theory can be applied to real-world situations.Class size: 22",

Globalization and the emergence of a new international division oflabor, has reframed the debates.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Human Rights; Philosophy This seminar is an exploration of radical American democracy. While most characterizations of democracy see it as a form of government, this course explores the essence of democracy as a specifically modern way of life. To do so, it turns to some great thinkers of American democracy such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Ralph Ellison, W. E. B. DuBois, and Hannah Arendt. What unites these radical democrats is the conviction that democracy is a practice of individuals rather than an institutional form of governance. As an ideal of radical individualism, American democratic thought offers, perhaps surprisingly, an aristocratic critique of the limits of democratic government even as it, seen from another side, makes possible our culture of narcissistic consumerism. Our aim is to understand the democratic spirit of radical individualism that has proven so seductive and powerful since its modern birth in the American revolution. Texts will include Emerson\u2019s essays The American Scholar and Experience, Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man and Arendt\u2019s On Revolution.

The origins of what has been called \"America\u2019s Mission\" runs from the very birth of the American Republic, when the founding fathers declared the United States to be \"an exemplar state\" to guide the political development of other nations, to George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to remake Iraq into \"a beacon of democracy in the Middle East.\" This course explores three core questions about America\u2019s attempts to promote democracy abroad. What explains the genesis and persistence of the centrality of democratic promotion in American foreign policy? How have American administrations endeavored to construct policies to advance democratic development on a global scale?And why have American attempts to create democracies abroad have so often fallen short of their intended goals? These questions are examined through a broad review of the debate about the role of democracy and human rights in U.S. foreign policy; what theories of democratization have to say about democratic promotion, and, finally, in-depth analyses of American efforts to promote democracy in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Artifacts and archaeological investigations have played a major part in the reconstruction of the meanings involved, while the depth of texts -- as compositions that took shape over time -- has been increasingly appreciated. This seminar involves understanding the social histories of Israel and the early Church as they shaped the biblical texts. This approach identifies the constituencies for which the sources of the texts were produced. By \"sources\" we mean, not the documents as they stand (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and so on), but the traditions that fed into those documents. The final, editorial moment when traditions were crystallized in writing is a vital juncture in the literary formation of the Scriptures, but is not solely determinative of their meaning. The unfolding of meanings within texts during the whole of their development explodes the claim of a single, exclusive meaning in biblical exegesis. The seminar will attend to the variety of meanings inherent within the Scriptures -- without limitation to a particular theory of interpretation, and with constant attention to issues of historical context.

Despite its antiquity and position within a relatively unknown literary tradition, the form, content, and imaginative world of Midrash have proven strangely compelling to contemporary readers. In the 1980's and 1990's, scholars claimed to have found within Midrashic hermeneutics approaches that recall developments in comparative literature, such as deconstruction, and frameworks like intertextuality. We will read selections from various midrashic compilations, apply different critical tools for understanding them, and consider their relationship to later forms of literature and criticism.

At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

Most of our time, however, will be spent with contemporary authors in the new and developing field of \"economic sociology.\" These authors help us to see the ways that the economy is \"embedded\" in society and in culture: in worldviews, in moral frameworks, and in social-relational structures. Topics covered in the course will include: (1) social patterns of consumption, (2) commodification of emotion in the service economy, (3) roles of law and social action in the branding of products and places, (4) social foundations of modern, industrial capitalism, and (5) social, moral, and legal meanings of money.

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

It asks how sexual identities and social categories of sexuality come to be and how they are maintained or changed over time. It examines how historically specific social contexts shape the meaning of sexual experiences and how we use sexuality to define ourselves, produce social hierarchies, and mark moral boundaries. We will begin with an introduction to theories of sexuality and consider the essentialist / constructionist debate. Then we use a historical perspective to look at the social institutions that help to produce, construct, and control sexual practice and identities, paying special attention to the role of gender, race, and class inequality. This will provide a basis for looking at the development of modern sexual communities, identities, and politics, including controversies over commodified sexuality and feminist debates about prostitution and pornography. Throughout the course will consider the important role of gender in the social organization of sexuality. We will also address how these social processes shape notions of personal identity and the self. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Historical Studies; Political Studies Classical sociological thinkers were unapologetic about thinking big. They sought to uncover the architectonic social forces of historical and cultural change, and to peer into the future toward which such forces might be leading. Has a new type of capitalism taken over the world? Have social ties like friendship and marriage been changed out of all recognition by new social conditions? Does religion still matter in modern societies, and, if so, how? In this course, we will survey the \"grand narrative tradition\" of sociology. We will begin with classical exemplars of this tradition, including Karl Marx, Max Weber, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Emile Durkheim. We will look at authors from outside the boundaries of canonical sociology, including Karl Jaspers and Henry Sumner Maine. And we will study more contemporary authors, such as Michel Foucault, Robert Bellah, Michael Mann, Samuel Huntington, and Philip Gorski. One goal of this course will be to help students reflectively develop research projects that involve historical and comparative research, or historical themes. Another goal of the course will be to help students consider the strengths and the weaknesses of macro-historical sociology.

It engages theoretical questions about relationship between the self and power, social control, the state, and the construction of knowledge. In doing so, the course also engages debates over agency and individualism. This subject straddles political and cultural sociology and links the micro-level of everyday experience with macro-level questions of power and politics. It covers the symbolic interactionist approach to social control, including Goffman, and how sociology broke with Enlightenment ideas about the individual. We delve into qualitative and historical research on patterns of governance and subjectivity in many contexts, including paid labor, consumer culture, psychological treatment, prisons, self-help groups, and reproductive policy. About half of the course focuses on the \"governmentality\" scholarship associated with Foucault that examines how authorities think about and enact forms of regulation and control. The course will enable students to examine questions of subjectivity and individuality, recent shifts toward \"neoliberal\" governance, and the politics of empowerment.",

Particularly in the post-9/11 era, cities are directly managing a wide variety of international issues and are hubs for the international movement of people, money and ideas. New York City is the ideal case study: city police are deployed overseas to monitor terrorist networks, financial institutions manage the global flow of trillions of dollars, the UN is the headquarters of international diplomacy, the city hosts a diverse mix of NGOs and major media, and New York is the destination for immigrants arriving from all corners of the world. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of cities as non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Where do cities fit in those debates? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence national and global policy-making, with a particular focus on cities? In addition, the course contextualizes students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, Human Rights Watch, New York State Homeland Security, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, and many others.

Although we will scrutinize video, radio, and multimedia journalism, this course primarily seeks to sharpen your understanding of and ability at expository writing on global affairs and you will be expected to write intensively almost every week.Class assignments will entail research and original reporting. We will read and discuss a representative sampling of articles and books by journalists about foreign affairs, and will include discussions with experienced reporters and editors about their work.

No longer is diplomacy confined to oak-paneled rooms and gilded corridors. This change, as New York Times reporter Mark Landler noted, \"happened so fast that it left the foreign policy establishment gasping to catch up.\" This course examines how foreign policy and international affairs are being shaped in the age of the Internet. Topics include democracy versus censorship, conflict, climate change and the environment, big data and privacy, global economics and the movement of capital. Among the questions we will explore are: \u2022   What is the changing nature of power? Are there actors? \u2022   How is the concept of the nation-state changing? \u2022   What constitutes world order in this new era? \u2022   How have the Internet, the mobile phone, and other technologies changed the conduct of foreign affairs?

Yet the character and distribution of power has changed dramatically since the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. For nearly two decades now, American primacy has defined the global power structure. This fact is an historic anomaly; at no time in history has any one state amassed the degree of military, economic, and political power the United States now enjoys. In fact, contemporary American foreign policy is premised on the assertion that the United   States must sustain its primacy against any potential challengers for the indefinite future. This course explores the character of power and war in this era of American hegemony. We will examine the vigorous debates over the objectives of American power, unilateralism versus multilateralism as rival approaches to exercising power, debates over what military power can actually achieve, and the potential for a global backlash against the United   States. Among other specific issues this course will address is the rise of China and India and the implications for global security and economic issues; rogue states and nuclear proliferation; the preventive war option to address shifting threats; the political and strategic future of the Middle East; terrorism as an alternative form of the power struggle and as a type of asymmetric warfare waged by nonstate actors; the continuing problem of humanitarian crises, failed states and intervention in the post-9/11 world; and the changing nature of global energy politics as an acute security issue.

It possesses a uniquely intimate relation to the real and for this reason has many applications outside the realm of fine art; nevertheless, from its inception photography has been a vehicle for artistic aspirations. This survey of the history of photography from its earliest manifestations to the 2000s considers the medium's applications - as art, science, historical record, and document.

The land, sea, animals, fish, reptiles, and human body--all served as objects of study, contemplation, and delight for early modern viewers. Curious artists and observers were enabled in their endeavors by recent technologies (the microscope and telescope) and recording methods (printmaking), while an insatiable audience for images of nature provided a ready market. Nature was celebrated as divine creation and explored as a place of violence and mystery. Her boundaries were tested and recorded in maps and landscape paintings, while her bounty was pictured in spectacular still life paintings, often staged as a contest between nature and art. Cultivated nature provided a place to play in the form of elaborate gardens, while more sedentary pleasures were to be found by armchair travelers immersed in the pages of books illustrating landscapes near and far. Early modern interest in the natural world was pan-European, but the course will focus on images, objects, and environments from present day Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. Media and materials to be discussed include: painting (still life, landscape, hunt scenes), drawings (anatomy studies, botanical illustrations), New World specimens, travel literature, anatomy lessons.

To imagine and write about a future ideal society requires a reconsideration of the ways in which life will be organized in space. Utopian thinkers utilized drawings, maps, and plans to give shape to their vision and illustrate future social and political reconfigurations. From Sir Thomas More\u2019s Amaurote (1535) to Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s Herland (1915) and Hakim Bey\u2019s The Temporary Autonomous Zone (1991), authors challenged the limits of imagination, providing designers opportunities for architectural experimentation. This course will examine key writings and architectural projects in an effort to unpack the history of utopian thought since the discovery of the New World, considering projects for socialist utopias, communes, and industrial colonies.

The course explores how a deepening knowledge of antiquity (the invention of archaeology!), an ongoing development of art/architectural theory, and the continued study of the natural world crafted a visual vocabulary able to address the existential challenge posed by the Protestant north.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Latin American & Iberian Studies Andr\u00e9 Breton, founder and leader of the Surrealist Movement, first visited Mexico in 1938 and the Caribbean in 1941. Politically supportive of Latin America\u2019s struggle against European imperialism, Breton was deeply interested in both its art and culture, and had a large personal collection of ethnographic artifacts. Surrealist journals and artists extolled \"primitive\" mythologies and were captivated by such \"exotic\" artists as Frida Kahlo and Wifredo Lam. This course plans to explore two areas: the rich and varied field of surrealism in both literature and the arts of Latin America and, to question the Surrealist fascination with non-Western culture. As numerous critics have noted, surrealism came alive in Latin America at the moment when it was waning in Europe, and continued to develop throughout the twentieth century. By looking through the double lens of art and literature, we will tease out answers to such questions as: What geographical, political, and/or social factors contributed to the widespread growth of Surrealism in Latin America? In what ways did cross-fertilization take place among the countries of Latin America, and between these countries and Europe? Did Latin American artists always feel comfortable being labeled \"Surrealist\" or was it viewed as another form of colonization? In what ways did the European Surrealists project their fantasies regarding the psychic power of the \"primitive\" onto Latin American creative production? Finally, we will examine the ways in which Surrealism and its influences survive in contemporary cultural production. Permission of the instructor required.

We will pursue relevant questions such as: what exactly are the criteria for inclusion in such categories, do art markets drive this labeling, how does this work function within the art world, are categorical borders crossed in order to fit the needs of exhibiting institutions, and finally how has Outsider Art impacted mainstream modern and contemporary art and are the dividing lines between the two still relevant? We will look at artwork produced within certain institutional settings such as mental asylums and prisons, as well as that produced by mediums, spiritualists and other \"visionaries\" working within what can be best described as a \"folk art\" category.

This course seeks to introduce major themes, objects, persons, and social currents of European Art from the 1770s to the 1850s. We will follow currents in Spain, Germany, Great Britain, and France. Major topics include changing definitions of neoclassicism and romanticism; the impact of the revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848; the Napoleonic presence abroad; the shift from history painting to scenes of everyday life; landscape painting as an autonomous art form; and attitudes toward race and sexuality. We will try to understand artworks from three distinct perspectives: the social, the aesthetic, and the political, and investigate how these forces intersected to both create and reflect \"the modern\" as it is understood today. However, revivalism, tradition, and conservative reaction were equally powerful factors in shaping the art of the period, and we will be particularly interested in the push and pull of old, new, and in-between. We do not cover architecture and sculpture in this course. There will be two research papers, two exams, and a class presentation.

In Rome, the first week focuses on the ancient city, studying the evolving role of public monuments as the republic transformed into an empire. The second week explores post-antique (up to the present day) reconfiguration of antiquities in order to construct political and theological meaning. The portion of the class in Rome is rigorous, consisting of over seventy hours of lectures at archaeological sites, in museums, and in churches. During the spring semester, the class analyzes the art seen in Rome and discusses the secondary scholarship. Requirements include two presentations (one on texts, one on art), two exams, and a research paper. The prerequisite for the class is successful completion of either Roman Art and Architecture (ARTH 210), Roman Urbanism (ARTH 227), or 16th-century Italian Renaissance Art, Architecture, and Urbanism (ArtH 236). The class is limited to sixteen students; priority is based on academic relevance and intellectual maturity. The cost of the Rome component is circa $1700 to include transportation in Rome, lodging, breakfast, museum admissions, and all but two dinners. Airfare is not included, and financial aid does not assist with this fee. Credit will only be awarded upon successful completion of both components of the class. Permission of the professor required.

The relationships between the artistic traditions of their native lands and their subsequent immersion in American culture provide material for fascinating inquiries concerning biography, style, subject matter, and politics. This class will examine artists active in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century as well as contemporary artists. We will take one or two trips to New York City to see art by Asian American artists, and the class will read several works of fiction by Asian American writers to supplement the art history readings. Students will give presentations about selected artists either historic or recent. Key artists studied will include Isamu Noguchi, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Yun Gee, Yayoi Kusama, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Patty Chang, Nikki Lee and Mariko Mori.

This course is designed for students wishing to experience an intense, three-dimensional study of modern dance rooted in and responding to the work and ideas of Trisha Brown. Technique class is structured as a laboratory where physical possibilities are explored with a mixture of rigor and freedom, specificity and abandon. Technique class will also be a place of critical thinking, where evaluation of movement concepts occurs through physical exercises, group discussions, and written reflection. Students must have a strong technical foundation, be self-motivated, and be capable of handling the demands of a four-day-a-week class. Readings, written assignments, and attendance at performances outside of regular class hours are essential aspects of the course, augmenting our intellectual understanding of technique and performance. Co-taught by Leah Cox and Trisha Brown Dance Company faculty. This class meets 4 days per week. Prerequisite: Sophomore status with the intention to moderate; ideally, students will have had two semesters of Intermediate-level modern courses.

What constitutes a game? Why do people play them? What makes digital gamesdifferent from non-digital games? What roles do games play in contemporary culture? How have game-like incentive systems and other forms of \"gamification\" infused non-game contexts, such as socialmedia, fine art, democracy, education, war, and the modern workplace? Do games and \"gamer\" cultureeffectively preclude, privilege, include, or exclude certain groups, identities, and worldviews? Coursereadings, screenings, and mandatory game play will augment and inform our investigation of thesequestions and beyond. The primary coursework will consist of game creation using tools and methodologies from computerscience and electronic art. Students will create original games (non-digital and digital video games), bothindependently and in groups. This work will be augmented by short assignments designed to buildfluency in visual art creation and interactive game design through short exercises in coding in Javascript,visual design applications, and Unity, a game design application. Assignments will push students todevelop experimental and critical approaches to game creation. This course is restricted to students in the lower college. Students with little experience playing games and/or a healthy skepticism about the cultural and artisticvalue of games are encouraged to apply.

How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"? How can performance artists use video playback devices, displays, projectors, and interactive elements to shape and enhance live art? Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities. The second half of the course concentrates on the use of video as a central component within live art events, plus a continued discussion about the larger cultural and psychological impact of live video production.

        "description": "Operating on the assumption that the study of film, a syncretic art par excellence, offers a particularly advantageous perspective on understanding the aesthetic underpinnings of 20th Century art, the course explores the relationship between a certain mode of cinematic achievement, for the most part labeled avant-garde, and the major tenets of modernist art, both visual and literary. Many of the films studied are by artists who worked in other media (such as L\u00e9ger, Strand, Cornell, and Duchamp) or whose work manifests a direct relationship to various artistic movements such as surrealism, futurism, and constructivism. An attempt is made to relate certain films to parallel achievements in photography, poetry, and music, with some attention paid to relatively little-seen filmmakers such as Lye, Kinugasa, and Jennings. Much of the assigned reading is not film criticism as such, but crucial critical works that help to define modernism in general, including those by Baudelaire, Pound, Ortega y Gasset, Moholy-Nagy, and Brecht. Other films studied are by (Europeans) Vertov, Eisenstein, Bu\u00f1uel, Dulac, Ruttmann, Man Ray; and (American) Deren, Brakhage, Anger, Snow, Gehr, Conner, Rainer, Frampton, et al.

In addition to studying many of Bergman\u2019s features, we will watch films by such wide-ranging directors as Carl Theodor Dreyer, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Mauritz Stiller, Lars von Trier, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Michael Haneke. We will read a range of relevant criticism, along with contextual material and works by figures such as Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.

From the other Stein-Thomson The Mother of Us All through Harry Partch\u2019s vernacular dance-plays to Robert Ashley\u2019s road operas for television to Meredith Monk\u2019s nonverbal Atlas to the information overload of Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach to Mikel Rouse\u2019s complexly pop theater works, American composers have often constructed stage works from nonlinear narratives that completely sidestep assumptions of theatrical realism. At the same time, there is another American tradition of operas that distance themselves from Europe in subject matter, though not in format: Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess, Copland\u2019s The Tender Land, John Adams\u2019s Nixon in China. The course will weave between these traditions, contrasting their effectiveness and looking for links that might define an American approach to opera. Coursework will include two research papers, listening to and watching videos, weekly reading of librettos, and plenty of class and Moodle discussion.

And yet, its premise- that human attention is riveted when a unified impression is created via maximum variety- is a fertile psychological principle relevant to many fields. Overall, this course will follow classical species counterpoint as outlined by the eminent Knud Jeppesen, based on the style of Palestrina. However, we will also examine the freer styles of earlier composers such as Josquin and Ockeghem, and generalize from contrapuntal concepts to such derivatives as the dissonant counterpoint of Charles Seeger and others. The ability to read music, and basic knowledge of musical terminology (intervals, cadences) are prerequisites. This fulfills a theory requirement for music majors. Class size: 20",

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves. Students should have experience in drawing and must have had Painting I, there will be no exceptions. Class size: 14",

        "description": "The monotype (a.k.a. the painterly print) emerges at the intersection of painting and printmaking. While technically it can be the moststraightforward and direct form of printmaking, one that strives *to honor the individuality of the hand\u2019s painterly impulse\", it also can be fantastically inventive and layered, incorporating many processes into one image. Monotypes are a wonderful tool for an artist to develop ideas of color, light, shape, and composition into singular expressions. In turn, they can become a rich resource of stimulation and information for other forms of visual thinking. This class will explore the process of the monotype in relation to painting using both traditional techniques and experimental ones that evolve in response to the pursuit of student\u2019s individual ideas. While specific assignments will be given in class, independence in direction and motivation is essential. This course\u2019s success depends on the evolving dialogue between your visual ideas and the monotype process. This means that you must come to this course with visual ideas that you intend to develop, whether abstract or representational, or both. Painting 1 or Printmaking I are the minimum prerequisites but it is highly recommended that you have had some experience with the pursuit of visual ideas of your own invention. Material needs will vary among individuals, but an array of oil painting materials and high quality paper will be required by all. Class size: 14",

The Seminar focuses on the development of the student as a thinking and working artist. This is accomplished through variety of approaches. Presentations are made by visiting artists and Studio Arts faculty who discuss their life and work. Students develop a series of projects designed to aid them in recognizing, conceptualizing, and articulating their particular artistic interests. Presentations by alumni from the Bard studio arts program provide a glimpse into the future; and, workshops on the photographing of art and website development help the student prepare for life after Bard. Exhibitions in the fall semester will draw students out of their studios well before the presentation of their senior show. Required studio visits from faculty members other than the project advisor insure fresh and varied responses to the ongoing senior project. The Senior Project Exhibition is the culmination of the Senior year and is evaluated before a faculty review board and a Senior Seminar critique. *Any student registered in Studio Art Senior Project or any student of another discipline who has been granted studio space in either the Fisher Studio Art Center or the U.B.S. Exhibition Center in Red Hook will be required to register and participate in all aspects of Senior Seminar.Class size: 30",

He was of course referring to her best-selling novel, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, a seminal work of 19th century American literature. It also has been adapted many times for the theater and performed all over the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine the important role this work played in the birth of an American theater and culture. We will begin with a close reading of the novel, then turn our attention to the various theatrical adaptations that were produced and toured the United States over the years. Among the questions that will be examined include: What role did the novel and its theatrical adaptations play in the formation of American culture and what do its theatrical adaptations tell us about what it means to perform \"American\"? What does it mean for its archetypal characters to be portrayed by performers of different races or genders? Also, we will look at the uses or misuses of dramatic literature as a form of popular entertainment as well as early American propaganda. Important to our inquiry are the relationships between Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, blackface and the roles, race and gender play in the creation of a contemporary American culture. Other works to be examined include Spike Lee\u2019s movie \"Bamboozled,\" the contemporary Broadway hit \"Hamilton,\" George C. Wolf\u2019s musical \"The Colored Museum,\" and \"Funnyhouse of a Negro\" by contemporary playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Close readings, in-class discussions, film screenings, performance projects, personal essays, and other project-based explorations of texts will round out the class. Class size: 28",

We will begin with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, focusing particularly on the understanding of poetry manifest within the world of these poems. Readings from Greek literature will also include lyric poetry (focusing on Sappho and Pindar), and Attic drama (e.g., Aristophane\u2019s Frogs and Clouds, Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound, Euripides\u2019 Medea and Bacchae). Readings from the Latin corpus will include epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry (e.g. Vergil, Horace, Catullus, Seneca). Concurrently, we will be examining the ongoing critique of literature from the fragments of early Greek philosophers (e.g. Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Heraclitus), through Plato and Aristotle, to Cicero and Horace. Our twofold aim will be to develop an understanding of all these texts in their original context and to consider how they set the stage for subsequent developments in western literature and criticism.

To what extent does such a work represent the general culture out of which it emerged, and to what extent does it reflect an individual consciousness? How does our assumption of who the author is affect how our reading of the text?

The seventeenth century\u2019s characteristic figure is Satan struggling against God in John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost \u2013 but other poets and dramatists like John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Andrew Marvell helped to shape the age\u2019s passionate interest in the conflict of political, religious, and social ideas and values. After the Civil War and the Puritan rule, monarchy was restored, at least as a reassuring symbol, and writers were free to play up the differences as they did in the witty, bawdy dramatic comedies of the elites and the stories and novels by Aphra Behn, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne which appealed to middle-class readers.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Jewish Studies; Russian & Eurasian Studies Isaac Babel (1894-1940) was one of the most perplexing geniuses of twentieth century Russian and European literature. Babel enlisted as a Jew in the famously anti-Semitic Cossack division of the Red Cavalry in 1920 and soon thereafter became one of the most famous writers in Soviet Russia; he escaped the fury of the Great Terror of 1937-38 only to be arrested in the spring of 1939 and shot as a traitor in 1940. The sum total of his writings was meager in comparison with that of most of his contemporaries; his political ambiguities are frequently infuriating; his defiant ironies often without clear target; his captivating literary style a puzzle of images and absences. He spoke of himself as \"the master of the genre of silence.\" In this class, we will attempt to unravel some of his many paradoxes through close readings of his masterpiece Red Cavalry, the 1920 Diary and The Odessa Stories. Background critical and historical texts, such as writings by Leon Trotsky, A. K. Voronsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky and pronouncements and documents of the Soviet government will provide a framework for understanding Babel\u2019s struggle as both Jew and Russian, as both a writer deeply imbued with the spirit of western humanism and one committed to the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution, and as both an incessant prankster and reflective spiritual vagabond. This class will examine his many attempts at finding a literary center that resolves the radical contradictions between his relation to tradition and to the growing nightmare of Soviet reality.

The course begins with the 1955 Bandung Conference and its call for Afro-Asian solidarity and non-alignment in the face of the either/or logic of Cold War. Aiming to curate a global \"non-Communist Left\" in its fight against Soviet cultural initiatives, the covertly CIA-founded and \u2013funded Congress for Cultural Freedom extended its efforts well beyond Europe after Bandung, beginning highly influential literary magazines, including Quest in India, Black Orpheus in Nigeria, Transition in Uganda, Hiwar in Lebanon, and several Latin American magazines, including the seminal Mundo Nuevo. The Soviets in turn built support for the Afro-Asian Writers Association, publishing their tri-lingual review of \"Afro-Asian writings\" \u2013 Lotus \u2013 from Cairo. In this course we will study the history of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Afro-Asian Writers Association after Bandung, reading selections from their Indian, Arab, African, and Latin American magazines, alongside theories of political commitment, decolonization, empire, liberalism, and Communism. Finally, the course will consider the context of cultural Cold War in the Caribbean, and the resurgent relevance of the Cold War to our own times, through a reading of Marlon James\u2019s recent novel A Brief History of Seven Killings.

This course will study the strange intersections of the physical, the social and the sacred we still recognize in sports. We will allot equal time to three different sets of readings: 1) case studies of the wedding of poetry to athletics in still thriving Oceanic cultures, from the Hawaiians to the Maori; 2) victory odes for the ancient Greek games, principally those of Pindar, praising victors in boxing, wrestling, running, pentathlon, pancratium (a.k.a Ultimate Fighting), chariot, and dithyramb; 3) sports poetry in Europe and the Americas, ranging from bullfighting and capoeira to ball games both in Classic Mesoamerica (Mayan and Aztec) and baseball poems in the 100 years. In all three parts we will not only study the poems themselves but also some scholarship by sports historians on the particular athletic events they reflect, and will view some video clips of the sports and poetry in action.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities When we think about Renaissance poetry, we tend to think of the sonnet: rule-bound, blatantly artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the poets writing in the Renaissance tried everything they could to make their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new. Just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration, madness, desire, and the sublime. This course examines, by focusing on the theme of love as a psychological, emotional, and political concept, how poets in the period fought with language in order to make poetry say things that could not be said otherwise. Our units will consider how both the concept of love and the poetic techniques used to articulate it intersect in surprising ways with political subversion, queerness, and religious doubt. Through both critical assignments and creative exercises, including engaging with digital media to better understand how the technologies of publication and the expectations of popular culture shape the transmission of ideas, we\u2019ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major works as well as less commonly-read (yet nevertheless indelibly great) poetry, in particular poetry by women; Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne and Milton will take their place in context alongside Mary Sidney, Robert Herrick, Katherine Philips, George Herbert, Amelia Lanyer, and Margaret Cavendish.

The term traditionally used to categorize this literature, \"romantic,\" is interestingly problematic: throughout the course we will question the assumptions built into this term instead of assuming that we know what it means or taking for granted a series of supposed characteristics of \"romantic\" literature and art. We will also explore the extent to which key conflicts in British culture during the \"romantic period,\" including the founding of the United States, independence movements in the Americas, the development of free trade ideology, and the debates over slavery and colonialism, are still at issue today. The centerpiece of this course is the close reading of poetry. There will also be a strong emphasis on the historical and social contexts of the works we are reading, and on the specific ways in which historical forces and social changes shape and are at times shaped by the formal features of literary texts. The question of whether \"romantic\" writing represents an active engagement with or an escapist idealization of the important historical developments in this period will be a continuous focus. Readings include canonical and non-canonical authors: William Blake, William Wordsworth, Helen Maria Williams, Thomas Beddoes, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, John Clare, and Laetitia Elizabeth Landon.

American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender, and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism\u2019s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\" Colin Jost, ofSaturday Night Live\u2019s\"Weekend Update\" joked that: \"The dating app Tinder announced a new feature this week, which gives users 37 different gender identity options. It\u2019s called: Why Democrats Lost the Election.\" Since the election of Donald Trump, the media has pitted minorities against working-class whites, with particular vitriol towards to LGBTQ community. Why has this presumed divide become the scapegoat for the Democrat\u2019s electoral loss? 2016 also saw the release of the filmLoving, which demonstrates how the legal impetus to overturn anti-miscegenation laws came from the working class. This ELAS class will work to counter that perceived divide by focusing on LGBTQ populations, particularly working-class ones\u2014white and of color\u2014in both rural and urban America. In additional to critical academic essays, texts will include works by Justin Torres, Leslie Feinberg, Dorothy Allison, Samuel Delaney, and E. Patrick Johnson. Films will includeBoys Don\u2019t Cry,Tongues Untied,Pariah, and others. As this is an ELAS class, our work will also focus on engagement within the community. We will welcome various speakers, and, most importantly, you will each do a community-oriented project\u2014at Bard, in the Hudson Valley, or in New York City. Class size: 18",

We will investigate who has had this right, where it has come from, and what it has had to do in particular with literature. and the arts. What powers does speech have, who has the power to speak, and for what? Debates about censorship, hate speech, the First Amendment and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be obvious starting points, but we will also explore some less obvious questions: about faith and the secular, confession and torture, surveillance, the emergence of political agency. In asking about the status of the speaking human subject, we will look at the ways in which the subject of rights, and indeed the thought of human rights itself, derives from a 'literary' experience. These questions will be examined, if not answered, across a variety of literary, philosophical, legal and political texts, with a heavy dose of case studies (many of them happening right now) and readings in contemporary critical and legal theory.

He was of course referring to her best-selling novel, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, a seminal work of 19th century American literature. It also has been adapted many times for the theater and performed all over the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine the important role this work played in the birth of American theater and culture. We will begin with a close reading of the novel, then turn our attention to the various theatrical adaptations that were produced and toured the United States over the years. Among the questions that will be examined include: What role did the novel and its theatrical adaptations play in the formation of American culture; what do its theatrical adaptations tell us about what it means to perform \"American\"? What does it mean for its archetypal characters to be portrayed by performers of different races or genders? Also, we will look at the uses or misuses of dramatic literature as a form of popular entertainment and as well as early American propaganda. Important to our inquiry is the relationship between Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Blackface and the roles race and gender played in the creation of a contemporary American culture. Other works to be examined include Spike Lee\u2019s movie \"Bamboozled,\" the contemporary Broadway hit \"Hamilton,\" George C. Wolf\u2019s musical \"The Colored Museum,\" and \"Funnyhouse of a Negro\" by contemporary playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Close readings, in-class discussions, film screenings, performance projects, personal essays field trips, museum visits and other project-based explorations of texts will round out the class.

Within Faulkner\u2019s narratives, slavery and its aftermath remain the disaster at the heart of American History.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Mind, Brain, Behavior Sigmund Freud conceived of psychoanalysis as a body of theoretical knowledge and as a clinical practice grounded in listening and interpretation. It is Freud who taught us to read slips of the tongue, bungled actions, memory lapses, dreams, and symptoms as speech in their own right, and to understand them as formations of the unconscious. He also showed us how, beyond communication, speech and language are constitutive of human subjectivity. In addition to inventing a practice to help patients, Freud\u2019s influence spans art, literature, and the human sciences\u2014fields that themselves greatly influenced Freud. This course will address fundamental concepts of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalyses (such as the unconscious, repression, transference, and drives), explore various affinities between psychoanalytic and literary insights into the human psyche and culture, and consider the ways in which the two fields can illuminate each other. Readings will include selections from Freud\u2019s seminal texts, as well as writings by Jacques Lacan, St. Augustine, Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, Isak Dinesen, Marguerite Duras, Xavier Marias, and W.

Prior to the arrival of this new technology\u2014which the sixteenth-century writer John Foxe deemed miraculous\u2014English books were made of vellum (sheepskin) and were written and decorated by hand.

We will learn how Shakespeare\u2019s writings are embedded in theatrical and literary traditions, and how they fit into a context undergoing tremendous social, political, artistic, and intellectual upheaval. Through careful investigations of Shakespeare\u2019s techniques, we will also discover how his writings engage philosophical and social issues relating to politics, sexuality, gender, and race that remain pressing today. While our primary aim will be to cultivate our close-reading skills, we will also draw on philosophical texts, theater history, film, and performance work. In addition to the sonnets, we will read representative plays that span Shakespeare\u2019s career, including Richard III, Love's Labour's Lost, Henry IV pt. 1, Macbeth, As You Like It, Othello, and Cymbeline.

Using as our focal point Max Nordau\u2019s 1892 bestseller Degeneration, which argued that contemporary artists like Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Richard Wagner, Henrik Ibsen and Friedrich Nietzsche were clinically insane, we will explore the prevalent late nineteenth-century identification of new literary forms with madness, criminality and perversion; we will also try to understand why the themes of disease, degeneration and cultural decline fascinated the very artists whom Nordau attacked, and inspired some of their greatest works.

The period from the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 through the French Revolution tends to be treated as a period of progress in Britain and Europe. It has been called the Age of Revolutions, referring to dramatic changes in politics, science, and political economy that produced new views of factuality related to scientific discoveries and mechanical inventions. However, this course explores the premise that new forms of fictionality equally characterized the emergence of modern civil society. From the scientific hypothesis, to historical conjecture, to economic prognostication, to the national lottery and other games of chance, eighteenth-century British society witnessed the proliferation of many forms of make-believe. By gathering together discussions of these different forms, this course will challenge the typical division between imaginative and scientific types of supposition. Readings will include works by Margaret Cavendish, Isaac Newton, Eliza Haywood, Daniel Defoe, Horace Walpole, Laurence Sterne, Adam Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and Jane Austen.

If literary theory rigorously questions things we take to be common sense -- what precisely do we mean when we talk about \"authors\" and \"texts,\" for instance? -- it also provides a space for the critical, creative linking of the literary to the social. How has colonialism shaped our ideas of the novel? What is the relationship between theories of intention and the performance of gender? And how do questions of racial difference intersect with models of narrative voice? We will read works that tackle these issues (and more) by theorists including Walter Benjamin, Judith Butler, Barbara Johnson, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Edward Said, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Gayatri\nSpivak, and Raymond Williams.

This course explores the myriad ways that Victorian writers, thinkers, politicians, and artists responded to seemingly timeless but persistently present poverty and its effect on the \"Condition of England.\" Focusing on texts as disparate as economic theory, aesthetic theory, the novel, and poetry and the rich tradition of nineteenth-century visual culture, particularly reproducible prints, oil paintings in both the English School and the Pre-Raphaelites, and nascent photography, this class aims to demonstrate how questions about and responses to poverty vary by discipline and media but also cut across them. To what extent is poverty an ethical, social, economic, political, or aesthetic problem? In centralizing social and economic class as the primary register of difference, we will think intersectionally about how poverty in nineteenth-century Britain attaches to certain marked bodies.

        "department": "litseminar",
        "description": "Cross-listed: French Studies The Useful, Schiller wrote in The Aesthetic Education of Man, is the great idol of our age. It divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead ends. Conversely, the impulse to play, to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seamless ability to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to supplement savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living). But conversation, precisely because it clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous for its proximity to the decadent and the idle. But what is so threatening about idleness? According to Nietzsche, because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing work. The work ethic has become an excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition. Paradoxically, work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse has been usurped by the false plenitude of mechanical labor. Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy: for the social climber, conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in appearing rather than being. This course examines how these tensions are played both on a rhetorical (we will study the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and on a thematic level. After reading a selection of critiques of \"pure\" work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and Nietzsche), we will examine the resistance to work (Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener), the philosophical ramifications of laziness (Goncharov, Oblomov), the prejudice against conversation (Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es, Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Misanthrope), the tension between work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena (Howells, The Rise of Silas Lapham) and instances where conversation becomes a mere filler (Woolf, To the Lighthouse, Chekhov, The Seagull). Students must email Prof. van Zuylen a one-page rationale explaining their interest in the topic. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Human Rights; Latin American & Iberian Studies; Middle Eastern Studies This seminar considers how culture in the third world became a theater for Cold War, focusing on the 1950s-1970s. The course begins with the 1955 Bandung Conference and its call for Afro-Asian solidarity and non-alignment in the face of the either/or logic of Cold War. Aiming to curate a global \"non-Communist Left\" in its fight against Soviet cultural initiatives, the covertly CIA-founded and \u2013funded Congress for Cultural Freedom extended its efforts well beyond Europe after Bandung, beginning highly influential literary magazines, including Quest in India, Black Orpheus in Nigeria, Transition in Uganda, Hiwar in Lebanon, and several Latin American magazines, including the seminal Mundo Nuevo. The Soviets in turn built support for the Afro-Asian Writers Association, publishing their tri-lingual review of \"Afro-Asian writings\" \u2013 Lotus \u2013 from Cairo. In this course we will study the history of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Afro-Asian Writers Association after Bandung, reading selections from their Indian, Arab, African, and Latin American magazines, alongside theories of political commitment, decolonization, empire, liberalism, and Communism. Finally, the course will consider the context of cultural Cold War in the Caribbean, and the resurgent relevance of the Cold War to our own times, through a reading of Marlon James\u2019s recent novel A Brief History of Seven Killings. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 15",

Rather than study queer theory in a vacuum, this course will trace its antecedents in feminist methodologies and its continued life, particularly in the realms of disability theory and studies of embodiment more generally as well as within some of the most contested sites of literary theory.

It remains one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. This course uses the work and career of Ralph Ellison to explore critical issues in the fields of American and African American literature.

We will read Ellison\u2019s fiction and non-fiction (and that of his contemporaries, predecessors, critics, and scholars) in order to examine issues of race and ethnicity, gender, language, identity, and technique, and we will also consider questions regarding canon formation and archive-building.

When and why did this trope -- suggesting some vital flame snuffed out -- become key to how we talk about the realities of biological, cultural, and linguistic precarity? How does one narrate the end, not of an individual organism, but of a form of life? And what social or institutional histories influence the designation of a given group or tradition as \"vanishing\" or \"endangered\"? For answers to such questions, we will look to early works of natural history; to ethnographic and historical studies of populations on the edge; and to literary works, from Romantic-era poetry to science fiction, that investigate the links between ideas of species, culture, sexuality, media, religion, and violence -- and that sometimes propose speculative alternatives to the narrative of extinction.

Auden commanded his listeners, \"Thou shalt not sit / With statisticians nor commit / A social science.\" In an essay of 1962, James Baldwin wrote, \"I am far from being convinced that being released from the African witch doctor was worthwhile if I am now\u2014in order to support the moral contradictions and the spiritual aridity of my life\u2014expected to become dependent on the American psychiatrist.\" The twentieth century saw an enormous surge in the cultural prestige and moral authority of psychiatry, sociology, and anthropology. These disciplines, rather than religion or literature, established the principal vocabularies through which human identity and the prospects for social change were articulated. This course, which combines the study of American literature and American intellectual history, will explore the ways in which literature both appropriated and resisted this cultural transformation. We will ask questions such as: what is the relation between humanistic and social scientific knowledge? How does literature represent agency and desire, and do those representations track with social scientific accounts? Can certain emotional or spiritual states be explained by appeals to psychological structure or social forces? How might a literary anthropology evade the canons of psychiatric normalcy? How does the moral imagination respond when the language of good and evil is displaced by that of health, adjustment, and alienation? Writers considered in this course may include James Baldwin, W.H. Auden, Vladimir Nabokov, Richard Wright, Nathanael West, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Saul Bellow, Marilynne Robinson, Joseph Heller, Theodore Dreiser, and Mary McCarthy. Class size: 15",

In this course, students examine, from the ground up, the elements of that architecture by asking what, in the most concrete terms, makes a poem a dynamic, saturated language event. Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, this workshop considers it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way, students encounter such aspects of poetic form as patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment. Writing for the course takes the form of creative responses to a wide variety of reading and weekly \"experiments.\" Class size: 14",

Over the course of the semester we will read from a broad range of classical and contemporary writers whose work is a deliberate hybrid of form, style, and genre. We will read essays that have the texture and imagination of a short story; stories that are closer to poems, journalists who use the tools common to fiction, and novelists whose work straddles the line between autobiography and fiction. Our reading for the semester will be based around broad, thematic concerns. We will discuss the relationship between form and content; the ethics of narration; and, ultimately, how we can apply the tools and techniques of the writers we\u2019ve read to our own creative and critical writing. This is a writing-intensive course. Students will be expected to write short, critical responses throughout the semester, as well as generate a substantial body of creative text. Class size: 14",

The purpose of the class is not to come up with a collective translation; rather, class discussions and independent research into the meanings of words inform participants enough about both French and English for them to arrive at their own individual translations of the poems. The class goes through the poems line by line, discussing the meanings of the words in the French originals and the boggling range of alternatives they present in English. The course functions as a writing workshop because learning to translate from a foreign language into English is writing at its most pure: it is the key to learning how to write resourcefully and powerfully, to knowing the weight and weft of words. Writing assignments are due every week and include both rigorous research into the French language and deep engagement with every writer\u2019s best friend, the O.E.D. Translation is supplemented by reading previous translations of Rimbaud as well as essays on translation\u2014not theoretical essays but writing on translation as a practice, a habit of mind. It is essential that students have both a passion for English usage and a background in the French language. ",

Beginning with the grapheme and glyph, we will examine linguistic figures such as image, metaphor, simile, and metonymy; read varieties of description and depiction, inquire about mimesis and ekphrasis, and investigate the relation between verbal particulars and abstractions. We will ask questions about the difference between a blank page and a screen, and contemplate the ways in which the digital age has altered our sense of near and far, the tactile and the corporeal; how the emphasis on visual information alters our relation to memory, narrative, and knowledge. We will consider the possible connection between the aesthetics of the visual and the Western bourgeois culture of desire. Possible readings drawn from Proust, Auerbach, Bachelard, Roland Barthes, J.

That\u2019s arguable. But it is true at least that a bat\u2019s experience\u2014or that of any other nonhuman consciousness\u2014is not inaccessible to humanimagination. In this course we will read and discuss a wide variety of texts, approaching the subject of nonhuman consciousness through literature, philosophy, and science.

The primary purpose is to guide seniors, both practically and philosophically, in the daunting task of creating a coherent and inspired creative work of high quality within a single academic year. Emphasis is on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This supplements but never supplants the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni/ae, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization, and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

This course will study the strange intersections of the physical, the social and the sacred we still recognize in sports. We will allot equal time to three different sets of readings: 1) case studies of the wedding of poetry to athletics in still thriving Oceanic cultures, from the Hawaiians to the Maori; 2) victory odes for the ancient Greek games, principally those of Pindar, praising victors in boxing, wrestling, running, pentathlon, pancratium (a.k.a Ultimate Fighting), chariot, and dithyramb; 3) sports poetry in Europe and the Americas, ranging from bullfighting and capoeira to ball games both in Classic Mesoamerica (Mayan and Aztec) and baseball poems in the 100 years. In all three parts we will not only study the poems themselves but also some scholarship by sports historians on the particular athletic events they reflect, and will view some video clips of the sports and poetry in action.

How did ancient writers think about difference? How do the ever-shifting boundaries of self and other shape the meaning of literature in antiquity? What is the relationship between structures of power and the literature of difference? In what ways can writing the world become a process of writing the self? This seminar will explore the invention of difference in antiquity in texts such as the Odyssey, Aeschylus\u2019 Persians and Suppliant Women, Euripides\u2019 Helen and Iphigenia among the Taurians, Herodotus\u2019 Histories, Aristophanes\u2019 Acharnians, Philostratus\u2019 Life of Apollonius, and Heliodorus\u2019 An Ethiopian Story. We will consider difference from several points of view: ethnicity, class, education, language, sexuality, and religious belief. We will also reflect on how our reading of ancient texts is informed by and can contribute to discussions of difference in other literatures and cultures, including our own.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Music This course will offer the opportunity to explore Russian history through the medium of Russian opera. Russian culture represents an inseparable part of European cultural experience. And yet, it has a distinctly original character. Initially shaped by the Orthodox Christian tradition passed on from Byzantium, it eventually came into contact and conflict with the flow of West European ideas. It absorbed and confronted, transformed and blended the major creative achievements of the Old World with the unique Russian experience. Predictably, the history of Russian music followed that path. The early development of Russian music benefited from appropriation of the Byzantine unaccompanied choral singing and at the same time suffered from the absence of instrumental music. By comparison, the Western European music combined the use of vocal and instrumental faculties and resulted in the creation of numerous forms of musical art, including the most elaborate one: opera. The flourishing of this genre in Europe consequently had a direct impact on the progress of Russian musical culture. During the nineteenth century, opera became a powerful agent in Russia\u2019s search for national identity. The list of operas includes such masterpieces as A Life for the Tsar by Glinka, Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina by Mussorgsky, The Tsar's Bride by Rimsky-Korsakov, The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin by Tchaikovsky, War and Peace by Prokofiev, and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk by Shostakovich. The assigned material will also include selected literary texts as well as video and audio recordings. You will also have a chance to attend a live performance of a Russian opera at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. No training in music is required. Conducted in English. Class size: 15",

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior.

In so doing students will gain skills in: developing ecological questions; formulating testable hypotheses; designing experiments; collecting and analyzing data; and presenting results in both oral and written formats. These skills will be learned through a hands-on process in which students conduct a series of individual and collaborative field studies that test core hypotheses in the science of ecology, spanning multiple scales of inquiry and with special focus on Hudson Valley ecosystems. Students will be exposed to a broad spectrum of species (e.g. microbes, plants, insects, vertebrates) and ecosystem types (e.g. meadows, forests, streams) and the different methods used in their study. Field techniques will include time-budgets, point counts and transects of wild birds, line-transects of amphibians and plants, sweep-netting and pitfall trapping of insects, seine netting of fish, and acoustic sampling of insects and birds.

This course is primarily about the latter. In it, we seek answers to why organisms evolve various mating strategies, what accounts for differences in sexual characteristics and mate choice among males and females, how organisms use signals, the information they contain, whether they signal honest information or whether we expect to see cheaters within populations, conflicts of interest between siblings, parents and offspring, males and females, and so on. We explore these questions through lab and field experiments and using evolutionary game theory, which provides the underlying framework for understanding the evolution of animal behaviors. The lab portion of the class will allow you to learn new methods and technologies (e.g. bioacoustic recording and analysis, avian point counts and transects) useful in studying animal behavior, work individually and in groups to design experiments and models to test your own hypotheses. Research will focus on captive animals in Bard\u2019s laboratories, wild animals on Bard\u2019s campus and within the surrounding natural landscape, and on captive animals housed in a local zoo. As a capstone achievement, you will identify an important basic or applied question in animal behavior and write a professional National Science Foundation-style proposal advocating for the funding of a research project of your own design.

What constitutes a game? Why do people play them? What makes digital gamesdifferent from non-digital games? What roles do games play in contemporary culture? How have game-like incentive systems and other forms of \"gamification\" infused non-game contexts, such as socialmedia, fine art, democracy, education, war, and the modern workplace? Do games and \"gamer\" cultureeffectively preclude, privilege, include, or exclude certain groups, identities, and worldviews? Coursereadings, screenings, and mandatory game play will augment and inform our investigation of thesequestions and beyond. The primary coursework will consist of game creation using tools and methodologies from computerscience and electronic art. Students will create original games (non-digital and digital video games), bothindependently and in groups. This work will be augmented by short assignments designed to buildfluency in visual art creation and interactive game design through short exercises in coding in Javascript,visual design applications, and Unity, a game design application. Assignments will push students todevelop experimental and critical approaches to game creation. This course is restricted to students in the lower college. Students with little experience playing games and/or a healthy skepticism about the cultural and artisticvalue of games are encouraged to apply.

This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to this remarkable theory. We will begin by establishing the structure of quantum mechanics in the context of its simplest case, the so-called qubit. Simultaneously, we will refresh the mathematical apparatus required to formulate quantum mechanics. To explore some of quantum mechanic\u2019s most interesting phenomena, including contextuality, entanglement, and nonlocality, we will next study systems of qubits. After an interlude on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, we will consider a variety of applications of quantum mechanics: 1-dimensional systems, including the harmonic oscillator, 3-dimensional systems, including the hydrogen atom, and quantum statistical mechanics, including that of identical particles as well as scattering and perturbation theory. We will conclude by learning the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. Time permitting, we will touch on such topics as decoherence and quantum computation.

        "department": "psychology",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant results was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact that a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) appeared this year. In addition, a diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size: 10",

How do public policies affect decisions to save for retirement, seek preventive medical care, or conserve environmental resources? John F. Kennedy captured a truth about human decision-making when he noted that \"the essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed to the decider himself.\" In this course, we will heed Kennedy's reminder that conscious reflection and verbal report often lead to inaccurate descriptions of the causes of our judgments and decisions. Our focus will be on trying to ascertain the underlying causes of these mental processes by relying on contemporary research in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, political science that offer the systematic study of how people make decisions given limited time and vast uncertainty. Sources will include empirical articles as well as review papers, videos, and case studies. We will consider applications of this work to domains such as finance, politics, the environment, and medicine.

We will begin with the history of these ideas but place a special focus on the empirical research of the past 40 years. After reading work in cognitive psychology that introduces us to foundational concepts such as implicit learning, memory, and perception (i.e., subliminal perception), we will spend the bulk of our time engaging with how these processes unfold in our social worlds (e.g., attitudes, prejudices, emotions, goals, self-esteem, and relationships). We will conclude by considering the implications of this research for notions of free will and individual responsibility.

This course will trace the history of the \u2018culture concept\u2019 from the nineteenth century to the present. In doing so, it will explore anthropological approaches to \u2018primitive\u2019 societies, group and personal symbols, and systems of exchange. It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project). We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, \u2018nature\u2019), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology\u2019s own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

Dinosaurs appear everywhere\u2014as plush toys and chicken nuggets, as corporate mascots and public monuments, and as metaphorical critiques of nuclear weapons. In this course, we will explore the figure of the modern dinosaur both as object of scientific inquiry and as popular culture icon. We will focus on competitive exploration for dinosaur fossils at the turn of the 20th century; rivalries between paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh; and the rise of dinosaur philanthropy in natural history museums. We will also consider how new paleontological discoveries provoked parallel shifts in meaning and representation. How are dinosaurs articulated and brought back to life from a distant geologic past? How are they employed as metaphors for dominance, size, dim-wittedness, and obsolescence? What role do they play in the making of power and nationhood? Through the close examination of scientific and cultural histories, museums, and popular media, this course will address our fascination with dinosaurs, and how the reemergence of these prehistoric creatures helped shape our modern world.Class size: 22",

We do not conceive of methods as simply a means to an end, or the application of established techniques for generating answers to prior problems developed in anthropological theory. Rather, students will be encouraged to think about the types of data that various ethnographic techniques can produce, the epistemological and theoretical assumptions embedded in them, and, most importantly, the ways different strategies for data collection can be combined to form an anthropological research project. To that end, students will develop and execute a short fieldwork-based anthropological research project over the course of the semester. Readings and discussions will guide students through the process of developing research questions, choosing a field site, generating data, and re-presenting that field site in writing. To complement the fieldwork projects, we will also read exemplary \u2013 and sometimes controversial - texts of ethnography in practice. Class size: 18",

Examining law breaking in the 21st century provides a lens through which to work through the meanings of states, citizenship, and identity. In this context, we ask: What constitutes criminal activity and who decides the answer to this question? How and when does crime threaten the state? What is the relationship between the violence of state and non-state actors? How can we rethink globalization through the lens of criminal activity? Readings will examine the experience of crime in post-Civil War San Salvador, criminality resulting from the securitization of the U.S.-Mexico border, the mirroring of criminal and state enterprises in Brazil, and surveillance technologies in Mexico City.",

The emphasis is on questions of strategy and organization and how these relate to wider ethical and philosophical issues. What were the challenges that campaigners faced? How did they resolve them? What alliances of interest did they confront? And what coalitions did they form to combat them? The course also considers the questions that emerge from consideration of these campaigns: how have human rights campaigners have engaged with\u2014and been part of\u2014wider political, religious and economic changes? Have the successes of the human rights movement\u2014particularly the expansion of international human rights legislation\u2014changed its character? When, if ever, are indigenous values more important than universal principles? What is the relation of human rights to religious values? Is human rights itself a quasi-religious belief system? Or just a political language? Finally the course considers the question of animal rights and the challenges this poses for the concept of rights and the extent of proper moral concern.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Global & International Studies; Literature Anthropological writing is diverse and innovative in both style and subject. Although \"ethnography\" and \"fieldwork\" are terms that have become widely used in other disciplines, writers identifying themselves as anthropologists are still at the cutting edge of research-based factual writing, usually about small-scale societies, both those on the periphery of the world system and those at the heart of it. The course examines the range of genres and techniques that anthropologists and others have used to convey the lived experience of other cultures. It examines the tension within the discipline between making these cultures comprehensible, respecting their difference and rendering them in a framework of theory. And it considers the aesthetic problems and ethical controversies that arise from writing at the limits of academic discourse. The genres addressed include classic field-based ethnographic monographs, travel narratives, historically-informed indigenous critiques of earlier ethnographies, reflexive accounts of the process of field work, journalistic reportage, visual documentation and works of fiction. The course takes the form of close readings of outstanding examples, drawn mainly from the anthropology of Africa and Latin America. These are set in context by accounts from other media. Texts to be studied will be drawn from the following: Bronislaw Malinowski A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term; Claude Levi-Strauss Tristes Tropiques; Oscar Lewis The Children of Sanchez; Ruth Landes City of Women; Sharon Hutchinson Nuer Dilemmas; Carlos Castaneda\u2019 Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge; Adam Ashforth Madumo; Don Kulick Travest\u00ed; Michael Taussig My Cocaine Museum; Leni Riefenstahl The Last of the Nuba; V.S.Naipaul A House for Mr Biswas; Katherine Boo Behind The Beautiful Forevers; Charles Doughty Travels in Arabia Deserta and Alma Guillermoprieto Samba.

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries. We apply the acquired theoretical knowledge to a range of current economic issues, including budget deficits and national debt, international trade, and the role of institutions.

While the discipline has come to be regarded as a core area of economics, its applicability extends far beyond the analysis of economic behavior. The object of this course is to introduce you to the basics of game theory, emphasizing its generality as an analytical paradigm for social science. We shall, therefore, focus on a wide variety of applications taken from economics, political science, and the study of the environment. Prerequisite: Econ 100 or Econ 101. Class size: 22",

The second part of the class is devoted to post-WWII Europe: reconstruction, the golden age, communism / socialism, the 80s turn around, Maastricht and the Euro, and the European crisis. The questions addressed include: What lessons does the Roman Empire teach us? What was the role of agriculture and urbanization in medieval Europe? Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges? The course is designed for inquiring minds who wish to understand how Europe came to be the major economic area it is now. Our approach is interdisciplinary (history, sociology, politics, geography, institutions\u2026); however we will insist on their economic aspect. Class size: 22",

The rest of the course is divided into three parts: the first part explores several key manifestations of development such as economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, globalization, inequality and poverty; the second part examines institutional determinants of development, including markets, political systems and culture; the third part deals with policies designed to address specific development goals, such as providing education, promoting gender equity or expanding access to financial markets. Classroom discussions will be supplemented by several book reports and discussions on popular contemporary books on development, and a semester-long case study each student will carry out on development experiences of a country of their choice.

Since Adam Smith, economists have used different assumptions, models and methodologies to study the role of markets, states, and institutions in the process of social provisioning. This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world. As we contemplate modern economic problems, sometimes the good old ideas produce the best new ideas. Prerequisite: Econ 100. Class size: 20",

Its research agenda reaches broadly into diverse aspects of economic and social theory. As a practical philosophy, geoclassical thought has roots in ancient Arabic and Hebrew traditions. As an analytical system, it emerged during the 17th through the 19th centuries in the political economy of John Locke, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Henry George. We review the classic and contemporary literature of geoclassical economics and explore its relationship to other schools of economic thought\u2014neoclassical, ecological, and institutional. We also examine applications to both contemporary and enduring social problems, including: the Great Recession of 2008; rising inequality; crushing private and public debt burdens; distortionary taxes and subsidies; ecological destruction, urban blight, and suburban sprawl; and territorial disputes.

The stories on the news are almost always connected with people, whether we observe them shouting bids in a trading floor or talking on two phones simultaneously. Financial markets are dominated by people behaving in many different ways. Yet traditional finance theories concentrate on efficient markets, predictable prices that are determined by the concepts of present value, rates of return and analysis and pricing of computable risks. Human behavior has neither a place in the theory nor a need to be studied. This prevailing view has recently been challenged by the new paradigm of behavioral finance that considers the many anomalies of \"rational\" behavior and \"efficiency\" of markets. The new paradigm concerns itself with economic decision-making and investor psychology, and specifically with questions relating to how and why people exhibit a mixture of rational and irrational behavior. The seminar will examine the influence of economic psychology in the decision-making process of various agents as well as in the market's dynamics. Several guest lecturers will also offer their informed views in the development of contemporary finance. Class size: 15",

At the same time, historian Craig Wilder's EBONY AND IVY (2013), linking elite American institutions to slavery, Brown University's disclosures of the fortune made in the transAtlantic slave trade by its founders, and the recent acknowledgement by Georgetown University of its sale of slaves to pay off antebellum debts are just a few examples of the ways in which the role played by institutions of higher learning in reproducing racial and other social hierarchies in the United States has been proven. How have these contradictory dynamics manifested themselves at Bard College? In this Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences (ELAS) course, we will explore this question by reviewing the College's evolving admissions policies toward blacks and the experiences of alumni of color at the College, and after graduation over time. Social profile, oral history, and mapping methodologies will be utilized. While the focus will be primarily on African Americans, we will also consider the history of similar student populations at the College. Class size: 22",

How did the revolutionary generation square their call for liberty and freedom with their dependence on slavery? Was John Brown a martyr and hero, or simply \"unbalanced to the verge of outright madness\"? Were Sacco and Vanzetti robbers and murderers or the victims of a political prosecution? What led four middle class black college students to the lunch counter at Woolworth\u2019s in Greensboro, NC in 1961 where they faced arrest and violence?

Although dating back in its modern form to only the sixteenth century, the concept of the experiment as an attempt to find underlying continuities in experience has numerous origins stretching back to earliest recorded history. In this course, we will examine how different experiments and artisanal practices have been used to interpret the natural world, and how those interpretations are reflective of the time periods and cultural contexts in which they were made. We will conduct our own experiments in replicability, discuss performance and the public culture of science, and explore the visual and material cultures of science. This course is required for those who wish to concentrate in Experimental Humanities. Class size: 20",

The course will take a long view of the origins, growth and expansion of the medieval kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai; and study the Hausa states, Yoruba chiefdoms, and the republican communities and city-states of the Igbo people, among others. Topics discussed will include social and political organization of West African societies; bureaucratic and government institutions, economy and trade, education and scholarship; military organization and warfare of states in the region. Salient features and transformations in traditional West African religion and modes of worship will be studied both in relation to their internal dynamics, and in the encounter of conflict and negotiation with Islam and Christianity. The extent to which trans-Saharan and trans-Atlantic commercial networks served to facilitate the exchange of economic, cultural and intellectual products and services with North Africa, the Mediterranean, Europe and the New World will be analyzed. The history of domestic slavery in West Africa and of the traffic of West African captives in the Atlantic World will be examined in the context of global developments. The character and progression of West African imperialism, sometimes actuated by territorial annexation or control, and sometimes by the propagation of Jihadist programs, will be studied side-by-side with the aspirations of European imperialism in the region as a precursor to the establishment of the Colonial State.

The course emphasizes the interaction between society, culture, and politics. Therefore, in addressing each of these broad themes, we will pay particular attention to their social and cultural aspects such as gender, labor, popular culture, and forms of protest. In addition to exploring modern Middle Eastern history, students will acquire critical thinking skills through examining primary documents and reflecting on the uses of history in contemporary contexts.",

Wells, daughter of two American slaves. Her campaign against lynching in the late 19th- and early 20th-century continues to complicate understandings of how and why black bodies are raced. She exposes lynching as state-sanctioned, extra-legal violence against black men and women. She challenges the legal double standards that erase the victimization of black women and the sexual agency of white women. In doing so, she put her life and livelihood on the line. In Wells\u2019 work, we see the matrix of more than a century of black feminist thought, critical race theory, and civil and human rights activism. With articles on New Orleans and East Saint Louis that address violence against the police as well as police use of excessive force, her work speaks urgently of the contemporary American predicament to which the Black Lives Matters movement responds. This course is part of the Courage To Be College Seminar Series; students are required to attend three lectures in the in Courage to Be Lecture Series sponsored by the Hannah Arendt Center.

This course questions whether this articulation of the United States\u2019 presence in the Middle East fully reflects American interests in the region. It also explores how US policy has oscillated between disengagement and intervention. Drawing on various sources such as government documents, consular reports, and propaganda posters, we will critically engage with these questions and unpack the features of US involvement in the Middle East from its beginnings in the late Ottoman Empire to modern day Iraq and Afghanistan. Alternative sources, such as popular slogans, songs, cartoons, and film, will allow us to explore Middle Eastern responses (both positive and negative) to American presence in the region. Topics include humanitarianism, imperialism, popular protest, revolution, and the appeal of American popular culture.",

We will approach these issues with the goal of understanding how certain portrayals facilitated Western imperialism toward China, even as imperialism generated the social, cultural, and political contexts in which those portrayals were produced. We will also explore how changing relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Euro-American world during the past three decades have generated new images of China, even as images from earlier periods continue to shape popular conceptions. Shared readings in theoretical literature discussing Orientalism, cross-cultural observation, and the politics of modernization theory will provide a common framework for our work. We will analyze representations of China in a wide array of sources, including popular histories, news reports, travel writing, academic works, novels, photographic essays, documentary and feature films, websites, blogs, and list-serves.

The final third of the course will focus on contemporary China in light of the history of the period of Reform and Opening (1978-present), since Mao\u2019s death. Fiction, film, television, advertisements, and other mass media will help us understand how contemporary China has developed in reaction to the Maoism of the previous decades.

Captivity in the early modern world engages questions of war and ransom as much as labor, religion, and race. It involves contracts, written or not, for renting, selling, buying, and freeing people. As such, captivity figures prominently in the so-called laws of war and peace. The language of the law, here, indicates varying degrees of legitimacy and becomes a touchstone for the changing morality of societies--with profound consequences for understandings of gender and power. Students will write an Africa-centered paper based on primary research.\nThis course will serve as a Major Conference in historical research. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights; Latin American & Iberian Studies In the last one hundred years, Latin America has been a place of extremely contentious, violent, and unresolved conflicts. Although the region is often considered a land of revolution, very few revolutions actually took place there in the twentieth century. Revolution and its possibility however had many unintended and traumatic consequences, including the rise of military regimes, state terrorism, and civil wars, with their attendant human rights abuses. This seminar begins with a study of the two major revolutions in the first half of the twentieth century, in Mexico and Cuba. It then focuses on the repressive reaction to the possibility or imagination of revolution elsewhere in the region, in much of Central and South America, in the latter part of the century. By studying twentieth-century Latin America from the perspective of both revolution and repression, the seminar allows for a more complete understanding of the region\u2019s recent human rights crisis and its legacy of trauma, both of which matter greatly to the region today.

        "description": "The major writing assignment in this course is an extended research paper on a topic of the student\u2019s choice, usually based heavily on documents from the relevant period. Class readings will consist of both primary source documents as well as the work of historians and social scientists. This course will touch on the entire range of American immigration history but it focuses on the period since 1870. Among the major topics to be considered this semester are 1) The great policy debates over restricting immigration. After decades of national debate, Congress finally ended mass immigration altogether in 1924; but another four decades of national debate led Congress to sweep away the 1924 law, leading to a new mass immigration, this time from the countries of Asia and Latin America. What generated these massive shifts in American thinking, ideals and resultant demographics? What role did international as well as U.S. political dynamics play in each of these shifts? 2) Mexican immigration to the US has been distinctive in several ways. It has continued over a very long period (well over a century); in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Mexicans came to have a unique place in the racial hierarchy of the Southwest; in recent decades, the sheer scale of the Mexican immigration and the presence of so many undocumented people in it have also been unique. How have all these features affected these immigrants and the larger society? Enrollment Limited to 12. This course fulfills the History Program requirement for a Major Conference. Class size: 12",

This course introduces major approaches to three such questions: How do we know what we know? What sorts of things exist? What sorts of things are we? Our emphasis will be on the (often conflicting) answers philosophers have given to these questions, but at least one other question about our endeavor will also be at issue: Is there a right and a wrong way to go about answering these questions \u2013 and who has the authority to decide? Readings will include classical formulations of and answers to these questions as well as contemporary versions and responses to them.",

An ancient tradition claims that we have a detailed set of inborn capabilities and limitations, rich in implications for how we can live our lives and organize society. An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are? We will investigate these and other questions in the course through an interdisciplinary mix of readings from philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and other fields. Class size: 22",

From there, we will turn to broader topics that cut across various art forms: Are serious (or \"high\") and popular (or \"low\") art to be understood and evaluated differently? How do we evaluate works of art, and why do we so often disagree on their value? And what, if anything, do the various items and activities that we classify as \"art\" have in common?

We will also screen a number of films and videos, including the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, Madonna's \"Truth or Dare,\" and documentaries on the pre-Stonewall femme-butch bar-scene culture of the 1950s and 60s, anorexia, rape on campus, the pornographic film industry, and several others.

The course will aim at doing philosophy and not only knowing philosophers. This distinction is important as areas with a legacy of epistemological colonialism, like the Caribbean, have many works that contain a substratum of philosophical ideas but have not necessarily been welcomed as canonical works of philosophy. Thus we will seek to engage in philosophy as a questioning activity that attempts to answer epistemic, aesthetic, normative and metaphysical questions. Some threads of analysis unique to this geography that this course will cover, include: the idea that philosophy is a contextual project rooted in a specific place rather than an abstract, ideal theory; the effect of colonialism on culture and education; the exploration of creolization; and the critical analysis of \"modernity\" as a European project. Course texts include works by Edouard Glissant, Wilson Harris, Eugenio Maria Hostos, Julia de Burgos and Franz Fanon.

Moving from the tradition of 19th century German critical thought through the birth of Poststructuralism and the 68\u2019 moment, this course traces the transformation of radical political thought from a theoretical discourse centered on Neo-Marxist critiques of social, political, and economic institutions to a form of politics centered on freedom, justice, and individualism. We begin the class with an examination of alienation, reification, and the call to revolutionary class-consciousness in the works of Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. These concepts provide a theoretical foundation for the tradition of critical theory that emerged from the so-called Frankfurt School in the works of Marcuse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Benjamin. Alongside these thinkers we will examine post-industrial society, enlightenment reasoning, and critiques of power. Transitioning to the emergence of Poststructuralist thought, we will look at some of the conceptual differences between Adorno\u2019s/Horkheimer\u2019s and Foucault\u2019s critique/s of reason. Following the historical transformations of radical political thought, we will survey how these traditions emerged and gave birth to contemporary political theory in the works of Habermas and Butler.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender & Sexuality Studies; Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights This course will introduce students to major theories and issues concerning gender and international security affairs. We will begin by examining the interdisciplinary literature on gender theory and applying its insights to international politics. What does it mean to conduct a \"gendered analysis\" of global affairs? How do gendered discourses produce our understanding of what is and is not understood as a national security problem? Why has traditional security studies failed to incorporate gender into its analysis? Then, we apply these theoretical frameworks to important security issues such as,the cultural effects of nuclear weapons, the targeting of civilians during armed conflict, sexual violence in war, torture and the war on terrorism, nationalism and the state, human security and development, and post-conflict societies, to name a few. Throughout, the gendered nature of security issues will be explored from multi-disciplinary perspectives drawn from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, politics and rhetoric in order to highlight the complex interconnections among states, societies and individuals. Historical and contemporary case studies will be drawn from a number of countries across the globe. In reexamining key concepts in the study of international politics\u2014namely, sovereignty, the state and insecurity\u2014this course has two goals. First, to expose how gendered discourses of security that focus on the state render invisible a multitude of threats to individual security. Second, to question the role of the state as a security provider by highlighting the insecurities individuals and societies experience as a consequence of state-centered national security policy.

Our mission is two-fold: to explain the U.S.\u2019s behavior toward the nations of Latin America, especially a pronounced propensity toward intervention and interference in the politics of the region--from diplomatic snubs, to economic embargoes, to military occupations; and to understand how the Latin Americans have responded to America\u2019s policies. Beyond that, the course aims to provide a broad overview of the historical and ideological roots of the many conflicts that over the years have dominated U.S.-Latin American relations. The course is divided into three sections. The first one covers the years between 1821-1940, and emphasizes American military interventions in Latin America intended to establish economic and political hegemony across the region. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War, 1940-1990, and emphasizes the real and perceived fears by U.S. policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to military interventions and covert actions in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Chile; and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon Latin America. The third section looks at the most salient issues in U.S-L.A. relations in the post-Cold War years, especially economic integration, narco-trafficking, immigration, and the War on Terror.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights (core course) When should states use military force to alleviate human suffering? Does the need to intervene to stop human rights violations outweigh the right of states to maintain control over territory? The international states system is built upon the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention. Yet over the past two decades human rights have emerged as an increasingly accepted justification legitimizing the use of force. This apparent tension between the respect for state sovereignty and the inevitable violations that result from the use of military force for humanitarian purposes is at the center of the debate over human rights in the field of international relations. This course explores the dilemmas and controversies surrounding the use of force for humanitarian purposes. The first part examines the major ethical, political and strategic arguments for and against humanitarian military intervention. The second part focuses on specific instances where states undertook, or failed to undertake, a humanitarian military intervention (for example, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Sudan, Libya and Syria, among others). Through an examination of particular case studies, we will better understand why the international community has such an inconsistent record of stopping humanitarian crises and what the limitations and possibilities of human rights are in international politics.

The first part of the semester looks at the history of the idea of constitutionalism in Ancient Greece, 18th century England, France, and the United States. The remainder of the semester will be devoted to a critical examination of the contemporary workings of constitutional law, focusing primarily on decisions of the highest courts of United States, India and South Africa relating to critical human rights issues. The course confronts core questions of the role of a constitution in the state and the particular challenges of a written constitution enforced by courts. By looking at constitutional enforcement comparatively, the course offers the opportunity to test theoretical assumptions and get beyond the US-centered approach that has dominated constitutional study for a variety of reasons (not least of which, the fact that the US has the longest and best established tradition of constitutional enforcement.) In addition to theoretical and historical readings, the course will include substantial case law readings. Students will also have the opportunity in their research to explore constitutional systems beyond South Africa, India and the United States. Beyond legal cases, readings include Aristotle, Montesquieu, Bodin, Arendt, and the Federalist Papers. Class size: 40",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender and Sexuality Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights Security is one of the foundational concepts in the study of international politics. As the principal rationale for war, the quest for security influences both states\u2019 behavior in the international system as well as the structure of state and society relations in domestic politics. Too often, however, the meaning of security is taken for granted in the study of international relations, with individuals, societies and states homogenized into one coherent model that focuses exclusively on the threat, use and control of military force. This seminar will interrogate this narrow concept of security by engaging with a diverse literature in international relations termed \"critical security studies.\" The critical security studies research agenda aims to denaturalize the common understandings of security that dominate the field of international relations and in doing so shows how security is socially constructed through specific and historically contingent political practices, which create shared social understandings and endow subjects with identities and interests. Some of the broad theoretical themes covered include how threats to security are defined and represented, gendered and feminist approaches to security, the emergence and effects of dominant discourses of security and the politics of threat construction. We will then apply the insights of the critical security studies approach to the contemporary security environment in the United States through a critical examination of the war on terrorism. The course ends with a discussion of the ethics of national security by looking at the politics of torture, human rights and the suspension of civil liberties in the state of exception.

Claims that the United States has been sheltered from the ideological contests of the rest of the world or that we are in a post-ideological era are receiving more scrutiny than ever. This class will seek to explore the idea that the United States has been substantially free of ideologies by examining different moments within U.S. political history and seeking to assess the coherence, influence, and origins of prevailing systems of ideas. Beginning with Jeffersonian republicanism and taking in Antebellum slavery, Abolitionism, Progressivism, Cold War Neo-conservatism, and Neo-liberalism (amongst others), the class will consider whether any of these impulses amount to an ideology and what, if any, legacy they left for subsequent American political thought. In the final classes of the semester we will critically consider the 2016 election cycle as evidence of a renewal of ideological impulses in the United States. Alongside primary documents from the relevant periods, the class will study secondary analyses of the periods in question and broader considerations of the concept of ideology. Participants will be required to design and carry out a research project related to the topic of the class over the course of the semester. Class size: 16",

Jewish communities have flourished around the globe \u2013 from the Americas to the Far East \u2013 and a dizzying variety of Jewish traditions (some would say Judaisms) have developed in these different climes, and during different times. Notwithstanding the common (mis)perception of a single Jewish ethnicity, Judaism presents humanists with a fascinating test-case of a distinct, even parochial tradition that constantly takes up new shape and color while, arguably, maintaining a \"family resemblance\" with parallel expressions of Judaism. This course introduces students to the many foundational practices, ideas, and expressions of Judaism while grappling both with its inner diversity, as well as its sense of dissimilarity from surrounding non-Jewish communities. We will emphasize the formative history of rabbinic Judaism in ancient and medieval times, and then consider the development, in modern times, of new traditions out of that Judaism, including Hassidism, the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment), modern European and American denominations (Reform, Orthodox, Conservative et al), Zionism, and contemporary \"cultural\" Judaism.

The topic of equality reaches into every area of human culture: local politics, national identity, international relations; political science, philosophy, jurisprudence, and literature; religious institutions; the military profession; economics, psychology, sociology, and history. Problems focused on equality have broad dimensions of theory and practice, contrasting what should be and what can be with what is. The examination of what equality means in these different areas holds up a mirror to ourselves. The project includes parallel seminar courses at both institutions using common reading material prepared by Bard and West Point faculty; four joint sessions that bring together the students and faculty collaborating in the project; an academic conference hosted by Bard College at which invited scholarly papers are presented and discussed. This course is part of the Courage To Be College Seminar Series; students are required to attend three lectures in the in Courage to Be Lecture Series sponsored by the Hannah Arendt Center.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender & Sexuality Studies, Jewish Studies Traditional Judaism is often seen as a highly patriarchal system in which women have little access to public ritual roles or community leadership. It enforces a strict separation between men and women in many social situations, and prohibits even casual physical contact between husband and wife during the wife\u2019s menstrual period. It defines some sexual acts between two men as an \"abomination\" for which capital punishment is prescribed. What are the origins of these practices, and the social, theological, and psychological attitudes that they reflect? This course will examine a broad sweep of issues relating to gender and sexuality in the earliest strata of Jewish historical development, that is, the biblical and rabbinic periods. Topics to be covered will include public and private gender roles; power dynamics between men and women; views of sexuality, marriage and its variants; homosexuality; etc. We will read both narrative and legal primary texts, as well as current scholarship on the development of these issues in the ancient world. Our goal will be to gain an understanding of some of the beliefs and values that drove the development of early Judaism. Class size: 22",

While the Talmud was composed during a specific period (third to seventh centuries) and place (Sasanian Mesopotamia), it has been read and reread in many contexts since, from Baghdad to Brooklyn (to Bard). Each reading has engendered new texts worthy of study in their own right. Often classified as a work of law, it is perhaps best to describe the Talmud based on what it does: unrelenting, interpretive and intertextual weaving. This course will attempt to tackle the Talmud and talmudic process by closely reading a representative sample of talmudic passages, and then adopting lenses provided by a variety of humanistic disciplines, including philosophy, history, literature, anthropology, and even performance studies. All texts will be provided in translation. No prior background in Jewish Studies is required, though some experience in textual analysis / hermeneutics is important. Class size: 16",

The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights One of the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century is understanding and advancing social, economic, and political development in marginalized places. Why does global inequality persist and why does a large share of the world\u2019s population continue to live in abject poverty, despite tremendous efforts made over the last half-century? Through the lens of specific topics, such as unequal impacts of environmental change, informal urban settlements and economies, and growing energy demands, this course examines such questions from two perspectives. First, we look at globalization and other structural forces that create and perpetuate global inequality. Second, we examine the goals and practices promoted by governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and communities. This course will push students to think critically about the meanings and consequences of development, as well as about the challenges and possibilities we face in addressing some of the major social problems of our time.

While these accounts provide a sensational and superficial treatment of various social problems, what do researchers really know about the causes of and solutions for these problems? This course provides a critical survey and analysis of the varied social and structural factors that facilitate and help perpetuate social problems in the U.S. Topics include: schools and education; wealth and poverty; racial and ethnic inequality; teenage childbearing; residential segregation; immigration and mobility; gender inequality; work and socioeconomic attainment. The course will also provide framework for developing the skill of academic writing, and the appropriate use of theories, research questions and hypotheses. In particular, this seminar will serve social science majors and other advanced students who are developing their research and writing skills for term papers and senior projects.

This course gives students instruction in how to conduct this kind of qualitative research. It focuses on ethnography (participant observation), in-depth interviewing, and discursive/content analysis. The course is ideal for students from various majors who plan to use these methods for their senior project or those interested in pursuing social research in the future. It offers both conceptual grounding and practical training. This means the class engages epistemological questions about how we create knowledge and the nitty-gritty aspects of how to design and carry out a study. We will address debates about reflexivity, objectivity, power, and perspective in research. We will also learn various approaches to designing studies and drawing conclusions from qualitative data. The course offers training in research ethics and human subjects (IRB) review. In the class, students will develop and conduct a qualitative research project and learn practical techniques for taking field notes, conducting interviews, picking case studies, and interpreting and analyzing qualitative data.

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant results was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact that a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) appeared this year. In addition, a diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size:\n10",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies Non-state actors have gained increasing importance in international affairs, and the expanded role of cities is often overlooked. Particularly in the post-9/11 era, cities are directly managing a wide variety of international issues and are hubs for the international movement of people, money and ideas. New York City is the ideal case study: city police are deployed overseas to monitor terrorist networks, financial institutions manage the global flow of trillions of dollars, the UN is the headquarters of international diplomacy, the city hosts a diverse mix of NGOs and major media, and New York is the destination for immigrants arriving from all corners of the world. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of cities as non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Where do cities fit in those debates? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence national and global policy-making, with a particular focus on cities? In addition, the course contextualizes students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, Human Rights Watch, New York State Homeland Security, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, and many others.

From prehistoric cave drawings to spatial history digital projects, topics will include mapmaking traditions in Western Europe, ancient and medieval China, Islamic Central and South Asia, pre-contact America, as well as the intersection of these practices and the application of digital mapping within this history.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Science, Technology, Society This class examines the relationship between theories of vision, and the production and reception of images, in European art and culture of the early modern period (ca. 1500-1750). During this time, ways of thinking about visual experience changed profoundly. The \"new science\" placed particular importance on observation, and a number of visual technologies (optical devices such as the camera obscura, telescope, microscope, and \"peepbox\") came into common use. At the same moment that ideas about visual experience were undergoing rapid change, older ways of thinking about vision (the experience of miraculous apparitions, and the dangers inherent in viewing seductive images, for instance) were still a part of everyday life. We will examine this complex moment thematically, considering topics such as: the historicity of vision; perspective systems and their distortion; deception and deceptive images (trompe l\u2019oeil); curiosity and connoisseurship; voyeurism; optical devices; visions of the divine; the image as evidence; the representation of sight. The class culminates in an exhibition, both online and on the Bard campus. Art History Distribution: Europe, 1400-1800. Class size: 22",

This class focuses on the commissioning of large-scale representational architecture, the creation of public space, and the orchestration of streets at seven sites in continuous use since antiquity. By charting the chronological development of these sites, the class examines the ongoing dialogue between the past and present in Rome. Requirements include critical essays, presentations, and tests. Completion of this class qualifies as a prerequisite for Roma in Situ (ARTH 248), taught during January in Rome and in the Spring at Bard. Open to all students.

        "description": "Like most established fields of study, photography has a canon: a well-worn history and literature that emphasizes a conventional set of figures and master narratives. This course will explore photography's history beyond the canon and beyond the standard Euro-American settings, in search of alternatives to conventional narratives. How, for example, has photography been appropriated and adapted by people who have more often been seen as the objects of the Euro-American gaze than wielders of the camera themselves? How can we read photographs by anonymous makers, or make sense of the inexhaustible reserves of vernacular photography? In addition to studying less familiar names and iterations of photography, we will also consider how canons are formed and why histories are constructed in particular ways. Our topics will touch on events and figures taken from the full 175-year sweep of photography's history. Class will take a lecture/discussion format; there will be substantial weekly reading, two exams and two papers. \nArt History Distribution: 1800-Present. Class size: 25",

Is it possible to create a new kind of dance product or new dance knowledge? What happens when we make work from a space of curious unknowing instead of confident knowing? In Comp III, we will investigate how we can reimagine the creative process in order to surprise ourselves with what it produces. We will draw from the movement-based ideas generated by philosophy, cultural studies, as well as dance makers past and present to generate our own processes and questions. We'll also explore the importance of working in other creative forms (such as visual arts and film) as a way to increase our understanding of our primary art form (dance, movement). Essential to our trajectory will be an increase in our dance literacy: our ability to see and speak about dance in its own milieu as well as understand its implications for and relevance to larger cultural contexts.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights.

        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 22",

Students will be introduced to foundational practices in electro-acoustic sound production and their contemporary/digital analogues, with particular emphasis on signal processing, studio and field recording, and modes of diffusion, including multichannel installation and live performance, and instruction in digital audio workstation software (Logic Pro, Pro Tools, and others). Examples from the history of electronic music will assist students in exploring contemporary approaches to electronic music software and technology. Enrollment in the course automatically gives students access to the Bard electronic music studios. In addition to the digital workstations, students can also explore analog synthesis techniques using the vintage Serge modular synthesizer. Class size: 20",

Both were influenced, albeit in very different ways, by folk music and both exhibited neo-Classical tendencies, again in very different ways. Both ended up in the United States and died in New York City. We will explore their respective cultural milieux in Budapest, St. Petersburg, Paris, and New York, and analyze some of their most important compositions, comparing and contrasting them at each stage of their careers. There will be reading and listening assignments, a midterm, a final quiz and two short papers (5 pages each). The course will count towards the music history requirements for music majors.

        "description": "The half-century from 1910 to 1960 saw an explosion of dissonance, complexity and apparent musical chaos. And yet, beneath the surface it was also an era of unprecedented intricacy of structure and musical systematization. The liberation of dissonance and dissolution of melody left composers insecure, and they often compensated by creating systems of tremendous rigor not always apparent to the listener. This course will analyze in depth several works that changed the way we think about composing, and which pioneered the growth of an atonal musical language. Explore the cinematographic intercutting of Stravinsky\u2019s Le Sacre du Printemps; the textural overlayering of Ives\u2019s Three Places in New England; the elegant mathematical proportioning of Bartok\u2019s Music for Strings Percussion and Celeste: the delicate symmetries of Webern\u2019s Symphonie Op. 21; the total organization of Stockhausen\u2019s Gruppen; and the compelling multi tempo climaxes of Nancarrow\u2019s Study No. 36. Intended for music majors, for whom it counts as music theory credit, but other strongly motivated students are welcome.

This seven-week class will survey episodes of musical protest in the United States from the Civil War to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. We will consider what the function, potential, and limits of musical protest have been in transforming American civic life. Our course will examine peace and abolition songs composed during the Civil War era, anti-capitalist and labor songs, songs against fascism, music of the Civil Rights Era, Vietnam War, Iraq War, activist music festivals, compositions that protest nuclear power and environmental damage, and recent music that addresses police brutality and structural racism. We will consider acts of musical protest aligned with \"the right side of history\" as well as music that challenges this very notion. We will include pieces that critique gender, class, and racial inequality in the United States, as well as pieces against violence, greed, and complacency. We end by analyzing songs that protest the very genre of \"protest music.\" Students will be required to write weekly reading and listening responses and produce a final research project around a single act of musical protest. You do not need to read musical notation to take this class. Class size: 22",

Tracing the historical developments of the movement, we\u2019ll analyze La Monte Young\u2019s The Well-Tuned Piano, a six-hour improvisatory piano work in altered tuning; Steve Reich\u2019s popular Music for 18 Musicians; Philip Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach; Tom Johnson\u2019s An Hour for Piano; John Adams\u2019s Phrygian Gates; and also postminimalist works by William Duckworth, Lois Vierk, Paul Epstein, Peter Garland, and others.

In addition to Beowulf and the Tempest, our readings will include Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales; Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History of the Kings of Britain; Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene; and several \"romances\"\u2014the pop fiction about knights and their adventures\u2014that circulated widely in both Chaucer\u2019s medieval and Shakespeare\u2019s early-modern England.

That power, diffused into the lives of individual Americans by technological, political, and social change, simultaneously deepened a sense of powerlessness for some and fulfilled hopes and expectations for others: if you imaginatively identified with the nation and its privileged symbols\u2014for example, whiteness, masculinity, weaponry, and material plenty\u2014would you experience the promised sense of centrality and significance seemingly mandated by our military triumph, our wealth, our extraordinary global prestige, and our historical sense of providential destiny? Or would you experience, or even be aware of, America\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises? In this course, we will be looking at the ways in which American literature imagined and represented what it was like to live American lives between August 6, 1945, and September 11, 2001, the day when American verities and pieties underwent a sudden reckoning. We will begin by asking ourselves and our writers the same question with which R.W. Emerson opens his great essay, Experience:Where do we find ourselves? and go on to examine works by mid-to late twentieth-century and contemporary writers of fiction, nonfiction, drama, and poetry. Moreover we shall do so through explicit reference to traditions and problems bequeathed to us by American writing from the seventeenth-century on. Can we still see ourselves as the City on a Hill? What has happened to the democratic faith of Emerson and Whitman? Do we possess a \"usable past\"? Is ours a society marked by \"quiet desperation\"?

It is often asserted that nature is ubiquitous in Japanese literary expression, but how and why did this come to be? How has nature been narrated, harnessed and reimagined at varying moments and locations, and how have the values assigned to it been deployed in the construction of national identity and in the processes of modernity? Exploring the tensions in the environment as an object of aesthetic appreciation as well as a potentially destructive force, our examination will also extend to varying political, social, religious, and ethical dimensions of the human responses to the lived environment, including what the natural environment and disasters can teach us. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, we will also be asking how attentions and concerns about environment have been raised and redirected, and will explore the emerging literary responses that have sought to grapple with life in an entirely changed landscape. Readings include a variety of fictional and nonfictional texts from the eighth century to the present, including classical court poetry, Matsuo Basho, Miyazawa Kenji, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Kawakami Hiromi, ecofeminist critics, Okinawan poetry, and an Ainu memoir.

        "description": "2 credits It is 2016. Why aren\u2019t there more women in leadership positions? According to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains\u2014most notably politics and business\u2014women continue to be under-represented at the top. This year\u2019s Presidential race will certainly polarize the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard\u2019s other campuses, we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address. This course is open to all first-year students, but enrollment is limited.",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Literature Recent debates in literary studies regarding \"close\" and \"distant\" reading methods have emerged alongside rapid innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These concurrent developments have sparked exciting collaborations between literary scholars and computer scientists (as evidenced by this co-taught course). Yet this burgeoning affinity can easily obscure the longer history of scholarly activity combining humanist and computational approaches to literature. In this course, we will chart the contours of this history -- stretching back to the early twentieth century -- and learn the fundamentals of NLP in order to consider new questions regarding changing literary patterns over time. We will read the works of foundational linguists and close-reading theorists (e.g., Victoria, Lady Welby; C. K. Ogden; I. A. Richards; William Empson; and Cleanth Brooks) as well as scholars of emergent critical reading practices (eg., N. Katherine Hayles, Franco Moretti, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best). We will explore these ideas by learning fundamentals of programming and then using them to apply NLP techniques such as parsing, sentence generation, language modeling, and creation of high-dimensional semantic spaces to problems in reading.

We will read writers of the so-called \u2018 Lost Generation\u2019 including Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald. But in our reexamination of \u2018The Lost Generation\u2019 we will also include expatriate writers best known for their participation in the Harlem Renaissance, such as Jean Toomer, Claude McKay and Jessie Fauset. The African-American presence in Europe which included the iconic figure Josephine Baker as well as jazz great Louis Armstrong altered this picture in ways that we are only beginning to appreciate. This course looks at a period in which American culture found roots abroad. Class size: 18",

This course begins with a history of reading, storytelling and book culture in Arabic during the rise of Islam from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries. We will consider the role of the market, the scholar's libraries, the sultan's court, and notions of edification and culture as they contributed to an Arabic sense of bookishness and narration. The second half of the course will revisit this legacy as it infamously erupts into the modern, appearing as the founding conceit of Don Quixote, the exotic allure of European fascination with the \"Oriental tale\" and A Thousand and One Nights, and, as Edward Said would have it, a narrative incitement to empire.

Also, we will pay special attention to the present state of research on Dostoevsky, starting from the classic studies by Mikhail Bakhtin, Joseph Frank, and some others, to the latest works by Russian, American, European, and Japanese scholars of Dostoevsky.By looking at Dostoevsky through the lenses of poetics, philosophy, politics, and psychology, we will try to understand what makes this 19th century Russian writer our contemporary.

We will examine how new media interacts with and transforms culture by considering the emergence of digital media and internet culture in relation to prior moments of media change, and discuss how such shifts have continually re-shaped our perceptions of time, space, publicity, knowledge, and identity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. We will read key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Henry Jenkins, Friedrich Kittler, and Marshall McLuhan), as well as contemporary fiction by authors such as Neal Stephenson and Gary Shteyngart that offer speculative visions of how digital media and human experience might determine one another in the future. As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. Class size: 20",

This question drives Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and will likewise guide our semester-long exploration of it. An instant classic after Chaucer\u2019s death in 1400, the Canterbury Tales inspired \"fanfiction\" almost immediately and has since been enshrined as an essential work within the English literary canon, counting writers from Shakespeare to T.S. Eliot among its later readers and admirers. At odds with (or perhaps partly responsible for) its current \"insider\" and canonical status, though, is the fact that the Canterbury Tales remains one of the most radically experimental works written in English. By turns beautiful and dirty, politically risky and calculatedly evasive, poetry and prose, the Tales tests, negotiates, and worries over the ways in which language\u2014written, spoken, read, overheard\u2014constructs reality. It challenges gender and class norms; queries and queers the relationship between tale and teller; and calls into question institutional authority and social hierarchy. Following Chaucer\u2019s lead, we\u2019ll grapple with how literature does (and sometimes does not) influence social change; that is, what\u2019s the point of telling stories? Class size: 18",

We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch ; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N.

        "description": "We have a complicated relationship with fictional characters. We are often drawn to them more than anything else in encounters with literature, theater, or film, but we also know, consciously or unconsciously, that they remain exactly what their name implies: circumscribed by typography, scriptedness, and the page or screen. On the one hand, characters may be understood as impressions or archetypes that are patterned on convention and social expectations. As such, they can tell us about the world that produced them, since they are enlisted in the kinds of situations that world promotes and recognizes. On the other hand, characters, according to E. M. Forster, are \"engaged in treason against the main scheme\" of a text; they feel like agents of resistance and individualism, and they seem to transcend both text and context as they reach out to us. This course studies the history of fictional characters in western literature, starting in classical Greece and Rome, moving through medieval and renaissance texts, and arriving at a discussion of character in the novel and in contemporary media. Texts may include Theophrastus\u2019s Characters, Plautus\u2019s Menaechmi, Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, and Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway. We will also track changes in discussions about characters by studying critiques ranging from Aristotle to Barthes, Cixous and Derrida. Students will engage in analytical, critical, and creative work throughout the term, and will be encouraged to build their own fictional characters and study their personal favorites.

Works marked as neuro-novels include Ian McEwan\u2019sEnduring LoveandSaturday, Jonathan Lethem\u2019sMotherless Brooklyn, Mark Haddon\u2019sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, Richard Powers\u2019The Echo Maker, Rivka Galchen\u2019sAtmospheric Disturbances, and John Wray\u2019sLowboy.

        "description": "Does poetry, as W.H. Auden once said, \"make nothing happen,\" or is \"the theory of poetry,\" as Wallace Stevens wrote, \"the theory of life\"? This course will, through an extensive study of four major British modernists\u2014-D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, W.B. Yeats, and W.H. Auden\u2014-examine the capacity of modern literature to both articulate and realize a comprehensive vision of life in its ethical, aesthetic, and political dimensions. We will be particularly interested in the way in which aesthetic practices, attitudes, and categories (disinterestedness, impersonality, beauty and sublimity, the ordering imagination) map onto ethical and political understandings of hierarchy, equality, otherness, feminism, and interpersonal relations. Related concerns will include: to what extent does this literature struggle to appropriate or even outmaneuver newly ascendant, competing discourses of human nature like psychoanalysis? To what extent can and should it evaluate or aesthetically transfigure major political events and social movements, and how did it intervene in the struggle between liberal democracy and fascism? Is it truly able, as many modernists hoped, to displace the moral agency of religion? Texts will include Lawrence\u2019s Sons and Lovers, Women in Love, The Plumed Serpent, and selections from his poetry and short fiction; Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves; and the major poems of Yeats and Auden. Because we are interested in these writers\u2019 ethical visions, we will also consult prose manifestos such as Lawrence\u2019s Fantasia of the Unconscious, Woolf\u2019s Three Guineas, and Auden\u2019s The Prolific and the Devourer.",

        "description": "This course follows the mutations of a career, Herman Melville's, that produced both hugely popular adventure novels and commercially disastrous narrative experiments. The latter category includes Moby-Dick; or, the Whale, to which we will devote extended time mid-semester. Topics of interest, both to us and to the other scholars we will read, will include race, law, sexuality, and the nonhuman environment -- all while keeping our eyes on Melville's distinctive aesthetics. To explore those topics, we will put Melville in conversation with artists who have adapted his works (e.g., Orson Welles); with writers who have theorized American democracy and the African diaspora in ways resonant with his thinking (e.g., Harriet Jacobs and C. L. R. James, who wrote a seminal work of Melville criticism while detained on Ellis Island); and with other historical figures, particularly on the Pacific Rim, whose lives have been closely bound to the history of whaling (e.g., John Manjiro). This is a Junior Seminar, and as such we will devote substantial time to methods of research, writing, and revision. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was a radical nonconformist in every aspect of his life. At the age of 18, he was expelled from Oxford for distributing his pamphlet,The Necessity of Atheism. Soon after, he publishedQueen Mab, a long poem that indicted organized religion as the root of all evil and prophesied the emergence of a post-moral utopia. The following year, Shelley eloped to Italy with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, the future author ofFrankenstein. Living in self-imposed exile for the remainder of his life, Shelley produced some of the most poetically and ideologically challenging literature in English. In addition to a close study of Shelley\u2019s work, this seminar will examine the major influences on his thought, from Plato to Schelling, as well as Shelley\u2019s impact on nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophers, from Marx to Levinas. This is a Junior Seminar, and as such we will devote substantial time to methods of research, writing, and revision. Class size: 15",

The aim of the class is to help you explore the possibilities of form in relation to your chosen subject-matter. Form, by definition, involves limits. Free verse is not free. The poetic line is one simple limit; tone and cadence and diction are aspects of formal limits. Then there are imposed or prescribed limits, like the decision to write using only nouns beginning with the letter \"M\", or to write a poem without any adjectives, or a poem written using a procedure that moves language into unanticipated places, or a sonnet.

The personal essay is an informal essay that begins in the details of everyday life and expands to a larger idea. Emphasis is placed on reading closely to discover the craft of the work: how scenes and characters are developed, how dialogue can be used, how the form can fracture from linear narrative to the collage. Students\u2019 works\u2014three long essays\u2014are critiqued in a workshop format. The course is for students with experience in writing workshops, fiction writers and poets who want to explore another genre, and writers who enjoy expressing ideas through the lens of personal experience.

This course will serve two purposes. The first is to read, in its entirety, a beautiful, scholarly and complete translation of a work that one fifth of the world\u2019s population consider to be the best novel ever written. The second is to learn something about the cultural history of China, in particular attitudes and conceptions of gender. The late-imperial Chinese interest in gender and sexuality anticipates many contemporary post-modern concerns. No one text captures these trends better than the eighteenth-century masterpiece Shitou ji, The Story of the Stone, better known under the title used for the 120-chapter version Honglou meng, Dream of the Red Chamber. This course will combine a close reading of the novel and its commentaries with a review of recent scholarship on sex and gender in late-imperial China. Taught in English. Class size: 18",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer (ca. 8th century BCE) are the twin pillars upon which the Western literary tradition stands; between them, these two titanic works explore issues of human life and civilization\u2014mortality and heroism; the relationships between the human and the divine, men and women, free will and fate; the confrontation between European and other cultures; the nature of poetry, tragedy and comedy\u2014that have remained central ever since. This course, designed to introduce freshmen to more profound and sophisticated techniques of reading and thinking about literary texts than they will have thus far encountered, will consist of an intensive reading of both epics in their entirety over the course of one semester, focusing on in-depth discussion and textual explication, with a heavy emphasis on how to write critically about literary texts. After two prefatory sessions, in which students will be introduced to the large concerns of the epic genre in general (archaic Greek civilization, the epic cycle, oral composition, the Homeric Question) and of these two works in particular (the \"heroic code,\" violence and warfare, the clash of civilizations, ethnography and exploration, homecoming narratives, marriage), we will read through the epics at a rate of two books per session, two sessions per week. Students will be introduced, by means of excerpts and shorter articles, to the immense scholarship on Homer, especially with respect to oral composition and the Homeric Question. A premium will be placed on participation in class discussion and timely posting to Moodle discussion boards. At least three papers, midterm, final exam.",

How should Alexander be understood -- as a tyrant of Hitlerian proportions, or as a philosopher-king seeking to save the Greek world from self-destruction, or as an utterly deluded madman? Such questions remain very much unresolved among modern historians. In this course we will attempt to find our own answers (or lack of them) after reading the ancient sources concerning Alexander and examining as much primary evidence as can be gathered. Students will attain insight not only into a cataclysmic period of history but into the moral and ideological complexities that surround the assessment of historical personality, whether in antiquity or in the modern world. No prerequisite, but students will be greatly helped by some familiarity with Greek history or civilization. Class size: 22",

From a variety of different perspectives, they all ask the question: why literature? How can literature serve as a response to a problem (be it personal or political), or, taken from another angle, why is the questioning at the heart of literature often seemingly the sole solution? This class will explore many of the ways in which, over the past three and a half centuries, literature has attempted to grasp its own essence. Readings from Diderot, Rousseau, Stendhal, Balzac, Nerval, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Breton, Sartre and Duras (among others). Taught in French.

        "department": "french",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature; Gender & Sexuality Studies The representation of private life in the nineteenth-century French novel coincided with the advent of Realism. Realism not only described the institutions that shaped private life (i.e., marriage, education, religion), but dwelled also on the discrete dramas occurring backstage--the solitude of the spinster (Flaubert's Un C\u0153ur simple), the plight of the child (Vall\u00e8s' L'Enfant, Renard's Poil de Carotte), the ambiguities of filial duties(Balzac, Eugenie Grandet, Flaubert Madame Bovary), the despair of domesticity (Maupassant's Une Vie), and the nature of neuroses (Zola, Nana). Using novels, stories, and short selections from journals and correspondences, this course will examine the emergence of writings previously considered too private, too personal to be viewed as literature. Students will also uncover the techniques that help dramatize these highly subjective conflicts (interior monologue, free indirect discourse, early examples of flow of consciousness). Issues of gender, sexuality, and the role of women in defining domesticity will be central. In order to situate these texts within a tradition that rethinks the self, there will be additional readings by Locke, Descartes, Kant, and Shaftesbury. Students will also read excerpts from recent anthologies about everyday life to examine the connection between literature, philosophy, social history, and anthropology. Taught in French.

The \"Middle Sea\" represented for millennia the locus of cultural encounters par excellence. As the current migration crises showcase, however, it also constitutes a key geopolitical space of negotiation between national pretenses and transnational mobility of ideas, cultures, and bodies. By virtue of its position at the center of the Mediterranean, Italy and its multilayered culture offered a number of provisional answers to the ceaseless struggles taking place between North and South, East and West, Orientalism and Occidentalism. The course will address pivotal works of Italian literature and cinema able to destabilize acquired assumptions on identity, migration, gender and exile, from Boccaccio to Montale, to Pasolini and Carlo Levi, with a particular focus on Mediterranean artists working in Italy today, such as Predrag Matvejevic, Boris Pahor, Elvira Dones and Ferzan \u00d6zpetek.

        "description": "In his essays Traveling Theory and Traveling Theory Reconsidered, Edward Said underscored the importance of context and geographical dispersal for revolutionary potential to emerge\u2014or to turn into domestication. In 1909 Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an Italian poet stationed in Milan, but born in Alexandria (Egypt), founded in Paris the modern avant-garde with the publishing of his first Futurist Manifesto. Futurism\u2019s breakthrough claims of refashioning Western culture from its very foundations rapidly spread all over the world. Futurism\u2019s inextricable conundrum of art, politics and performance would then impact not only historical avant-gardes, from Dada to Surrealism, but also the idea of the intellectual as \"arsonist\" throughout the 20th Century. This course approaches Italian Avant-gardes\u2014with a focus also on Metaphysical Art and Magical Realism\u2014in the transnational circulation of aesthetics of the early 20th Century, between bombastic nationalist claims and tragic negotiations with Fascism. Engaging with both literature and art, the course unravels the intricate, yet fascinating knot of aesthetics and politics at the core of modernism, by studying the birth of the avant-garde and its many contradictions between national anxieties and global movements of ideas.

Are we all selfish machines controlled by our genes? This research intensive course will explore different experimental and empirical methodologies to study fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. Throughout the semester, students will learn how to \"measure\" the action of natural selection at different time scales using fossils, field sampling, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations. In addition, students will design and conduct an evolution experiment as part of an independent research project. More specifically, students will learn how to use whole-genome sequencing to identify the genetic mutations responsible for adaptation in experimental bacteria populations. Finally, students will study the lives and ideas of individuals associated with important developments and controversies in evolutionary biology while learning how evolutionary thinking can improve our understanding of current public health and societal issues.

How is the spread of a disease like the formation of a thought? This seminar series will examine the use of mathematical and physical models in biology with the goal of showing how the same conceptual framework gives quantitative intuition for very different biological systems. We shall develop four physical tools (scaling analysis, random processes, network theory, and information theory) and apply them to a wide range of biological systems from microbiology, neuroscience, botany, zoology, and epidemiology. Classes will alternate between lectures, in which a new model is presented, and student-led discussions of recent papers which apply the model. Students will read contemporary research and work in groups to present this research and solve problem sets. Prerequisite: Upper\nCollege standing in biology, or permission of instructor.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Literature Recent debates in literary studies regarding \"close\" and \"distant\" reading methods have emerged alongside rapid innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These concurrent developments have sparked exciting collaborations between literary scholars and computer scientists (as evidenced by this co-taught course). Yet this burgeoning affinity can easily obscure the longer history of scholarly activity combining humanist and computational approaches to literature. In this course, we will chart the contours of this history -- stretching back to the early twentieth century -- and learn the fundamentals of NLP in order to consider new questions regarding changing literary patterns over time. We will read the works of foundational linguists and close-reading theorists (e.g., Victoria, Lady Welby; C. K. Ogden; I. A. Richards; William Empson; and Cleanth Brooks) as well as scholars of emergent critical reading practices (eg., N. Katherine Hayles, Franco Moretti, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best). We will explore these ideas by learning fundamentals of programming and then using them to apply NLP techniques such as parsing, sentence generation, language modeling, and creation of high-dimensional semantic spaces to problems in reading.

It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project). We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, \u2018nature\u2019), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology\u2019s own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

This course explores the ways social groups enact, resist, and transform power relations in various times and places. Through an analysis of the 2016 elections in the United States and other contemporary case studies, we look at how anthropological theory and ethnographic practices can illuminate political phenomena, from the dynamics of small social groups to large-scale electoral politics and from the micropolitics of race, gender, and social identity. Subjects explored in this class will include classic anthropological analyses of small-scale societies, the formation of the modern nation-state, civil society organizations, post-colonial forms of resistance, and identity politics. While the course focuses primarily on understanding various political forms, students will also be encouraged to apply readings to theorize modes of inhabiting and transforming power relations they encounter in their everyday life. Assignments will provide students the opportunity to apply these readings to examine political processes on campus, in the United States, and around the world. Class size: 18",

In what ways has violence become naturalized in the contemporary world? In this course, we will consider how acts of violence challenge and support modern ideas of humanity, raising important questions about what it means to be human today. These questions lie at the heart of anthropological thinking and also structure contemporary discussions of human rights. Anthropology\u2019s commitment to \"local culture\" and cultural diversity has meant that anthropologists often position themselves in critical opposition to \"universal values,\" which have been used to address various forms of violence in the contemporary world. The course will approach different forms of violence, including ethnic and communal conflicts, colonial education, torture and its individualizing effects, acts of terror and institutionalized fear, and rituals of bodily pain that mark individuals\u2019 inclusion or exclusion from a social group. The course is organized around three central concerns. First, we will discuss violence as a means of producing and consolidating social and political power, and exerting political control. Second, we will look at forms of violence that have generated questions about \"universal rights\" of humanity versus culturally specific practices, such as widow burning in India and female genital mutilation in postcolonial Africa. In these examples, we explore gendered dimensions in the experience of violence among perpetrators, victims, and survivors. Finally, we will look at the ways human rights institutions have sought to address the profundity of human suffering and pain, and ask in what ways have they succeeded and/or failed. Readings will range from theoretical texts, anthropological ethnographies, as well as popular representations of violence in the media and film. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights Western fantasies have historically represented Africa as the embodiment of a mythical, primordial wilderness. Within this imagery, nature is racialized, and Africans are constructed as existing in a state closer to nature. Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness perhaps best exemplifies this process, through its exploration of the \u2018savage\u2019 dimensions of colonialism in the African interior. Imperial discourses often relied on these tropes of savagery and barbarism to link understandings of natural history with ideas about racial difference. Similarly, by blurring the boundary between the human and the nonhuman, colonial policies created a zone of anxiety around racialized domestic relationships, particularly in the context of employers and their servants. Many of these representations were contradictory, as evidenced by Rousseau\u2019s image of the noble savage: indigenous people who lived as gentle custodians of the environment, while at the same time preying upon resources desired for exclusive colonial use. After investigating the racialization of nature under imperial regimes, we will consider continuing legacies in post-colonial situations. How have certain ethnic identities been linked to nature? How do these associations reproduce social hierarchies and inequalities? In what ways is race invoked in struggles for land and resource rights? Through an exploration of ethnographic accounts, historical analyses, and works of fiction based in Africa, this course offers a new way of deciphering cultural representations of nature, and the fundamentally political agendas that lie within.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Science, Technology & Society In popular understandings, we tend to think of scientists and engineers as occupying relatively apolitical positions. While debates over government funding priorities or diversity in the laboratory occasionally pop up, we usually imagine scientists at the laboratory bench striving for the discovery of objective truths and engineers seeking to innovate new solutions to technical problems. By contradistinction, this course begins from the premise that science and technology are inherently political acts. That is, they are both the product of social conditions and, in turn, the condition of possibility for our collective ways of life. In calling science and technology political acts, we do not seek to dismiss their forms of practice (nor, for many of the authors we read, their claims to objectivity). Rather, in this course, we strive to understand how the how the existence of these expert communities affect and are affected by democratic politics. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies, Human Rights This course is intended as an introduction to advanced theories of culture in contemporary anthropology. Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture. Required for all moderated Anthropology majors. Class size: 15",

The macroeconomics component studies the aggregate behavior of modern economies - the factors leading to economic growth, explanations of booms and recessions, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and budget deficits or surpluses \u2013 and the government\u2019s ability (or inability) to use monetary and fiscal policies to achieve economic goals such as full employment and price stability.

In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class.

Many young people today fear that Social Security will go bankrupt long before they will reach retirement age. Costs of medical care continue to grow faster than GDP. Many private pensions are underfunded, and employers are switching from defined benefit plans to risky defined contribution plans. Will we be able to take care of growing numbers of seniors? If Social Security fails, will you have to support your own parents? Will you be able to accumulate enough retirement savings to see you through your \"golden years\"? How has \"Obamacare\" ameliorated gaps in our healthcare system? Does the proposal pushed by Bernie Sanders to extend Medicare-like coverage to all Americans make sense?

We will grapple with the controversial question of government intervention by examining the theoretical justifications for and against intervention, the optimal level of intervention, and the effects of complete absence of intervention. We will also discuss specific economic policies that deal with important problems such as inflation, unemployment, poverty, financial crises, and other. The relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies will also be discussed. Prerequisite: ECON 202 . Class size: 15",

While this is part of the general agenda of microeconomics, industrial organization distinguishes itself by its emphasis on the study of firm behavior in imperfectly competitive markets. The primary objective of this course is to investigate how firms acquire market power or the ability to influence the price of their product; the strategic behavior of firms that possess market power; and the effect of policy intervention in such industries.

It traces the complex processes of conquest, empire building, and the creation of many diverse, complex, and dynamic communities, societies, and cultures from the convergence of Native, European, African, and Asian peoples. The course considers peoples in the Spanish and Portuguese Empires of North and South America in three centuries, from the late fifteenth to the early nineteenth century, starting with the first native settlements and indigenous societies. Focusing primarily on the Conquest of Mexico, empire and indigenous society in Mesoamerica, and African slavery in Brazil, the class is based mainly on original sources like codices, native language writings, and documents on the history of Brazilian slavery. It will reflect on the peoples, places, events, as well as beliefs, cultures, and conflicts of a world different from our own to understand the historical legacies of the colonial period in contemporary Latin America.

In modern times Jewish culture became more voluntary and more fractured. While some focused on Judaism as (only) a religion, both the most radical and the most typical way in which Jewishness was redefined was in secular terms. In this course we will explore the intellectual, social, and political movements that led to new secular definitions of Jewish culture and identity, focusing on examples from Western and Eastern Europe and the United States. Topics will include the origins of Jewish secularization, haskalah (Jewish enlightenment) and Reform, acculturation and assimilation, modern Jewish political movements including Zionism, and Jews and the arts. In addition to secondary historical texts we will pay special attention to a wide variety of primary source documents.

Why did Japan\u2019s transformations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to the total war of the 1930s and 1940s? And why did the horrible destruction experienced after World War II ultimately result in rapid economic growth and renewed global importance for Japan after the 1950s? These questions provide the framework for our study of modern Japanese history. Throughout the course we will focus special attention on Japan\u2019s distinctive urban culture, the changing role of women in Japanese society, the re-invention of Japan\u2019s imperial institution, the domestic and international effects of Japanese imperialism, and the question of the United  States\u2019 role in Japan\u2019s post-war reconstruction.

Each week we will illuminate pivotal transformations in the era using different methodologies and forms of history, ranging from demographic and gender history to diplomatic and military history. The class will thus offer an in-depth presentation of key aspects of modernity and a survey of contemporary historiography. Issues discussed will include: the relation of the agricultural and industrial revolutions to long-term ecological and demographic change; the intensification of capitalism as the basis of social organization; the coextensive development of competing ideologies of conservatism, anarchism, socialism, communism and liberalism; the role of Europe in the global economic system, \"scientific racism,\" and neo-colonialism; the creation of new institutions of technological research, patent, and communication; the wars of the twentieth century, systematic genocide, and the development of a military-industrial technocracy; the transformation of the state system through the European Union; and the effect of mass media on definitions of the public sphere and political action. A rudimentary grasp of modern European history is assumed, but supplemental reading will provide a broad narrative base for students with no background in the field.

How should Alexander be understood -- as a tyrant of Hitlerian proportions, or as a philosopher-king seeking to save the Greek world from self-destruction, or as an utterly deluded madman? Such questions remain very much unresolved among modern historians. In this course we will attempt to find our own answers (or lack of them) after reading the ancient sources concerning Alexander and examining as much primary evidence as can be gathered. Students will attain insight not only into a cataclysmic period of history but into the moral and ideological complexities that surround the assessment of historical personality, whether in antiquity or in the modern world.

This field also entails broader histories of piracy, censorship, and the making of modern subjectivities. To understand the relationships of a technology to its social contexts and consequences, we will study: 1) how books were made in the early age of moveable type; and 2) how books were used to teach people how to do things in the world. With respect to the former, the course will include hands-on workshops in letterpress printing and digital book-making. Toward the latter, we will read from the how-to manuals that abounded in the period, including free-standing books and pamphlets on such diverse subjects as agriculture, conversation, cookery, fishing, medicinals, handwriting, spiritual exercises, housewifery, domestic service, fencing, witch-hunting, weaponry, shoe-making, and navigation.

Shanghai and Hong Kong, as international industrial and business centers, and the main conduits for overseas direct investment, are China\u2019s global cities, but they are cities with long, cosmopolitan pasts. This course explores the history of Hong Kong\u2019s and Shanghai\u2019s current economic, social, and cultural dynamism, and in doing so probes the historical roots of globalization. It analyzes how nineteenth- and early twentieth-century colonialism and semi-colonialism both drove and conditioned, in somewhat different ways, the development of these two cities. It also asks how this earlier phase of integration into global networks of commerce and culture relates to the patterns of the present. Through diverse sources such as fiction, film, drama, advertisements, photography, memoirs, and comics, we will delve into how economic and cultural flows have affected politics, economics, and the culture of everyday life over the past century and a half.

Taking a long-term historical perspective, this course explores the centrality of migrants and refugees to the formation of the modern Middle East. Drawing on multiple cases of mass displacement from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, we will investigate historical processes that resulted in the uprooting of diverse populations throughout the broader Middle East (including the Balkans and Iran). Topics include war (inter-state and civil), population transfers and exchanges, voluntary and forced migration, assimilation and integration, and exile and memory. In addition to secondary historical texts, we will explore the course theme through diverse primary sources such as fiction, poetry, memoirs, photography, and film. Class size: 22",

We will examine patterns of reaction variously termed passive, armed, cultural and spiritual resistance. We will also look at the range of behaviors among bystander groups including collaboration, inaction, and rescue. By reading a number of scholars with widely varying views, including Hannah Arendt, Yehuda Bauer, and Isaiah Trunk, we will grapple with the issues raised on several levels: Theoretically, what are the most useful definitions of these terms? Empirically, how can we assess the extent of resistance and collaboration that took place historically? Ethically, what types of behavior are \"reasonable\" or morally justified in such extreme circumstances? This course is designated as a Major Conference for students in Historical Studies. All students are required to write a substantial research paper considering these questions as they apply to a particular event or group during the Holocaust or another historical case study.

How have particular modes of history developed in relation to nationalism, imperialism, and the emergence of the modern state? How have modern historical techniques served to produce ideology? Moreover, how has history provided a tool for unmasking and challenging different forms of domination and the ideologies that help to perpetuate them? This course will address these questions through theoretical readings that offer diverse perspectives on the place of narrative in history, the historian's relation to the past, the construction of historiographical discourses, and the practice of historical commemoration. Other readings will critically assess the powerful roles that historical narrative, commemoration, and institutions like the museum have played in the processes of imperialism and nation building, as well as in class and gender politics. Some of the writers to be discussed will be Hayden White, Dominick LaCapra, Michel Foucault, G.W.F. Hegel, Walter Benjamin, Joan Wallach Scott, and theorists active in the Subaltern Studies movement. In addition to our common readings, students will write a research paper that builds on the critical perspectives we have discussed during the semester. Students who have moderated in history are particularly welcome. This course satisfies the Historical Studies Program's historiography requirement. Class size: 15",

How have they continued to challenge and shape our social and cultural conceptions of individuality, education, political responsibility, and social engagement? In what ways do the arts contribute to our political culture and education as citizens? In the 1990s, the defense of the arts as exemplary of democratic freedom and diversity failed to save the federal grant program for individual artists. Are the arts not just exemplary of, but fundamental to, our democratic culture, even essential to its continuation? How is reconsideration of the founding conceptions of our democracy a philosophical task? How is it a task of the arts and critical writing about the arts? We will explore these questions through discussions of philosophical works by John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Stanley Cavell; Hollywood films of the 1930s and 1940s; works of feminist philosophy by Marilyn Frye and Nancy Bauer; and works of art and criticism by James Baldwin, Bruce Nauman, Glenn Ligon, Claudia Rankine, and others.

However, political scientists and economists do not always use the term in the same sense. Even within these two disciplines the term has multiple meanings. The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

We will also look at the role of actors like the EU, Turkey, China, Japan and Iran, the military equation and the nature of American interests as they are affected by Russia. Readings, lectures and conversation with Russian and American experts will give you a sound foundation from which to understand both the forces at work and the nature of American debate about policy options. With this background, students will look at current U.S. policy and the leading alternatives.

The first explores the philosophical foundations of the notion of human rights and its contested universality, and the historical developments that propelled human rights to the forefront of international politics, especially the atrocities of World War II committed by Germany's Nazi regime.The second part of the course focuses on the evolution of the so-called \"international human rights regime,\" or the main actors and institutions in the human rights arena responsible for promoting and policing human rights--from the basic legal framework of human rights (the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights), to major multilateral human rights institutions, such as the UN Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court, and the European Court of Human Rights, to prominent non-state actors such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and the International Center for Transitional Justice. The third part examines the evolution of human rights, especially the shifts from \"first generation\" human rights (political freedoms) to \"second generation\" human rights (social and economic rights, such as housing, employment, and education), to \"third generation human rights\" and beyond (cultural self-determination, economic sustainability, and sexual freedoms, among others); and the means by which these shifts have come about andhavespreadaround the globe, such as international socialization,globalization, and policy diffusion.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights What does it mean to be a global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.This course will be taught concurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions. Class size: 22",

Much of the emphasis is on the evolution of democracy across the region, including examining such questions as why it has taken so long for democracy to take root in Latin America, at least in contrast to the United States and Western Europe, and why does the quality of democracy varies so greatly across the region. Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa  Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 18",

What are these \"security dynamics\" that risk instability? This class will identify and address some of the primary security concerns animating the interest in the region and the ongoing calls for an American presence. We will cover the debates surrounding the \"rise of China\" and the implications that has for the US-China relationship, but we will also focus on intra-regional concerns such the proliferation and development of nuclear weapons and the potential remilitarization of Japan. As well, we will identify and explore the nature of some of the major regional maritime disputes (China-Japan, South China Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan, and multilateral security institutions. Finally, we will identify potential areas for security and cooperation within the region as well as with major players internationally. Class size: 22",

But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

Students will study the grand strategies of these powers from the time of the Spanish Armada through the Cold War and analyze contemporary American policy in the light of the three centuries of Anglophone world power.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies This advanced seminar explores the military, economic and social sources of great power competition in international politics. We begin by examining how the major theoretical paradigms of international relations explain patterns of cooperation and conflict among great powers and consider the relative importance of material versus ideational variables in shaping great power politics. We then evaluate these perspectives in light of the historical record, to illustrate the varied dynamics of interaction among great powers under different political conditions. Historical cases covered include: the unification of Germany, World Wars I & II and the emergence of and peaceful end to the Cold War. Contemporary topics include the resurgence of Russia, the rise of China and the future of American power. The course aims to gain a better understanding of the relevance of great power politics to international order, to appreciate the importance and limits of historical analogies in understanding world politics, and to learn the art of using historical research in international relations. This course will benefit from several joint meetings with a similar class at the United States\nMilitary Academy at West Point throughout the semester. Class size: 15",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Historical Studies This course examines the political and historical development of the US presidency from the founding until the present day. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part of the course, we explore the emergence of the modern presidency as the central institution of the American political system. In addition to the founding, we will give special attention to the Jeffersonian and Progressive Eras as well as the expansion of executive power under FDR. Throughout this first part of the course we will also examine how the presidency developed various powers beyond the formal constitutional responsibilities of the office, including party leadership, control of the executive branch, and relations with the public. In the second part of the course, we will critically explore the operation of the modern presidency from FDR to the present. In particular, we will see how modern presidents contend with multiple, and, at times, conflicting roles and responsibilities (party leader, chief executive, commander in chief, media celebrity) in an increasingly complex political environment. In the third part of the course, we will consider the problem of contemporary presidential power. In particular, we will ask whether presidential power is enlarged or diminished in the present era of divided government, hyper-partisanship, intensified media culture, economic and ecological volatility, and the shifting geopolitical environment confronting the United States. We will also ask what role presidential power and leadership should play in the life of contemporary American democracy. We will consider these questions in light of the Obama presidency and the 2016 election. Class size: 15",

The importance of cultivating compassion and wisdom, and the hard realities of impermanence and death are among Buddhism\u2019s guiding concerns. Across diverse cultural landscapes, Buddhism comprises a wide array of philosophical perspectives, ethical values, social hierarchies, artistic and literary traditions, and ritual technologies. It is linked to politics, cultures, institutions, and personalities, just as it is geared towards renunciation. Buddhism\u2019s various faces can seem inconsistent, and they are frequently out of keeping with popular expectations. This course offers an introduction to Buddhism\u2019s foundational themes, practices, and worldviews. As we highlight commonalities, we will also pay attention to the variations that occur as Buddhism interacts with different cultures over time, considering topics such as gender, the place of the arts, and the defining features of religion more broadly. Beginning with Buddhism\u2019s origination in India, we will trace its spread and development throughout Asia, focusing on China, Japan and Tibet. We will also consider its more recent developments worldwide. Class size: 22",

In this seminar students read and analyze poetry from Buddhist cultures, including Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan literary traditions. Our focus is on poems that are emblematic of Buddhist themes such as impermanence, interdependence, perception of the present moment, renunciation, and empathy. We also read and discuss poems from Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic traditions to situate Buddhist poetry within a wider context of religious literature. Considering a broad scope of religious literature allows students to analyze how poetic forms work to express common themes such as the nature of the self and the relationship to the divine. This course focuses on primary source materials in translation. Our primary aim is to pinpoint aspects of Buddhist philosophy that lend themselves particularly well to \u2013 or perhaps even require \u2013 poetic expression. Class size: 22",

The focus of the course will be primarily on ancient Zoroastrianism, and on the classical textual tradition, especially the Avesta and Middle Persian literature. We will also examine Zoroastrianism in Colonial India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and across the Diaspora; look at the great variety of Zoroastrian responses to modernity; and consider the appearance of Zoroastrianism in modern media, including film, works of modern philosophy (mostly famously,Nietzsche)and novels. Apart from opening a window into an influential, if little understood, religious tradition, studying Zoroastrianism will allow us to consider key issues in the study of religion, such as the dynamics of influence and the evolution of religions. NOTE: No previous knowledge of the topic is expected, even as engagement with any of the major religious traditions will be illuminated by the study of Zoroastrianism. *Class will meet August 31, Sept. 7, 14, 21, 28, Oct. 26, Nov. 2, 9, 16, 30, and Dec. 7, 14.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

This course will allow students to explore these dynamics through an introduction to urban sociology: the study of social relations, processes, and changes in the urban context. We will begin by reading perspectives on the development of cities, followed by an examination of how the city and its socio-spatial configuration affect and are affected by social interactions, particularly across gender, race, and class lines. The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" Class size: 22",

We will begin by asking the obvious question: why would sociologists study the economy? We will briefly explore three \"classical\" answers to this question, which come from foundational thinkers: Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Most of our time, however, will be spent with contemporary authors in the new and developing field of \"economic sociology.\" These authors help us to see the ways that the economy is \"embedded\" in society and in culture: in worldviews, in moral frameworks, and in social-relational structures. Topics covered in the course will include: (1) social patterns of consumption, (2) commodification of emotion in the service economy, (3) roles of law and social action in the branding of products and places, (4) social foundations of modern, industrial capitalism, and (5) social, moral, and legal meanings of money.

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

Our focus will be on Eurasian traditions, which have been influencing one another for a very long time. We will begin in Ancient Iraq and India, and from there we will move to Israel, Athens, and Rome. We will then travel to medieval Europe, cycling back around to the law schools of Istanbul (Constantinople) and Beirut, and glancing briefly at Islamic Jurisprudence. We will conclude with the Enlightenment, and modern legal systems. Our comparative focus will be on the differing social types who have engaged in law-giving and law-finding activity: kings, priests, and prophets; philosophers, clerics, and scholars; rhetoricians and \"professionals.\" We will seek to understand the ways that these social actors may have thought about what they were doing, and the social-historical conditions under which they engaged in their distinctive forms of activity. The fundamental goal of this course will be to reveal the rich cultural lineages of modern legal systems, and the historical particularity of such systems. This course is part of the \"Difficult Questions\" cluster of courses; students will be expected to attend parts of the Hannah Arendt Center Conference \"Real Talk: Difficult Questions about Race, Sex, and Religion\" on October 20-21.

You will learn to think about drug use as a historically situated social practice by examining how social forces shape patterns of drug use, drug markets, and drug cultures. In addition, the course examines the history of US drug policy, the social construction of drug problems, and the far-reaching consequences of the war on drugs. Although the class focuses on the illegal drugs and other \"problem\" substances in the United States, we also consider the development of pharmaceuticals and their role in processes of medicalization. Finally, you will examine the history of the idea of addiction and its links to both criminalization and medicalization. Throughout, we unpack how medical, penal, and self-help approaches to drug control and treatment reflect differing modes of governance and embed assumptions about human nature. The course situates these questions in politics of race, class, and gender. Class size: 22",

From transnational advocacy groups to terrorist networks to multinational corporations, a diverse range of actors are challenging and limiting the power of traditional nation-states and changing the landscape of the international system. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Given the diversity of non-state actors and their goals, can we study them from a single perspective? Under what conditions do non-state actors \"matter\" and what effects do they have? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence policy-making? What role do non-state actors play in global governance? The goal of the course is to provide students with a working knowledge of the major academic debates and controversies about the definition, emergence and evolution of non-state actors in international affairs. We will investigate the changing roles and influence of non-state actors in a variety of issue areas, including global governance, security affairs, human rights, public health, international development and international economics, among others. In addition, the course will contextualize students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, Human Rights Watch, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, Central American Legal Assistance, Control Risks Group, East/West Institute, Asia Society and many others.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Medieval Studies; Theology This course offers a thematic look at the art object called an \"altarpiece.\" The altarpiece has long been central to the narrative of western art history, and much of the late medieval and Renaissance art now in museums once belonged to this type of object. Developed in the fourteenth century as a painted or carved image program placed on an altar table, the altarpiece became a site for artistic innovation. Focusing on medieval and Renaissance examples from across Western  Europe, this course explores the development, function, iconography, and art historical and liturgical significance of important altarpieces. Where possible, it considers altarpieces in their original context. In addition to short writing assignments, students will write two papers and give an oral presentation. Class size: 22",

While some philosophers and theologians during this time postulated the superiority of humans to animals, other thinkers expressed uncertainty about the status of humans. Over the course of the semester we will study paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, and decorative and food arts where this uncertainty is articulated. Specifically, we will focus on the ways in which the human-animal boundary is tested, explored, or delimited in zoos and menageries, scientific illustration, taxidermy, physiognomic studies, hunting and hunting scenes, still life paintings, depictions of fables, myths, and history in which animals play a central role, elaborate banquets featuring animals, and representations of domesticated pets and livestock.

We begin by studying the pre-existing debate over realism in art that forms the back story for the complicated reception of photography, and work forward to the Pictorialist movement at the end of the 19th century. Along the way, we will discuss topics such as: photography\u2019s status as \"the bastard child of art and science,\" \"passing\" (i.e., how to make photographs that look like art) photography and art pedagogy, pornography, the fine art nude, and Victorian mores, photography\u2019s role in the \"liberation\" of painting, and the 20th century repudiation of the 19th century photography\u2019s art aspirations. Intended for moderated students, preference given to students who have already taken ARTH 113 or any of my courses in 19th c. art.

Our investigation will begin by looking at the group of artists who took Robert Dunn\u2019s composition class in 1962 in New York City and who were considered to be the first generation of postmodern dance artists. From there, our scope will expand to consider these artists\u2019 trends alongside modernism and postmodernism\u2019s philosophical developments, modern and postmodern characteristics of other art forms, and significant political and cultural developments influencing the modern/postmodern distinction. We will delve into these topics through video, class discussion, focused weekly readings, reflective analysis assignments, and embodied explorations. The course will culminate in a final project comprised of a paper and presentation focusing on a line of inquiry chosen by each participant. This course fulfills the dance history requirement for the dance major and is open to non-majors. Class size: 15",

The one-year sequence, conducted as a lecture course, is designed to give the student a broad introduction to the history and aesthetics of film from a roughly chronological perspective. There are weekly screenings of major films widely acknowledged as central to the evolution of the medium as well as supplementary reading assignments which provide both a narrative history and a strong encounter with the leading critical and theoretical issues of cinema, often within a context of 20th century art and literature. While the student can take either half of the sequence, the program recommends that both parts of the course are taken, especially for any student contemplating film as a concentration. Mid-term and final exams; term paper. The second half of the sequence begins with crucial films in the transition to the technology and aesthetic of the sound film on an international scale, those by Lang, Sternberg, Bunuel, Vertov and Vigo. There follows a study of the evolution of the long-take, deep-focus aesthetic in the films of Renoir, Welles and Mizoguchi; of Hollywood genres in the films of Ford, Hitchcock, Hawks and Sturges; the rise of neo-realism in Rossellini, DeSica and Visconti; the contribution of the American avant-garde in Deren, Peterson, Brakhage, Anger, Smith, Conner and Breer; the French New Wave in Godard, Truffaut and Rohmer; the northern tradition in Dreyer and Bergman; selections of Asian filmic practice in films of Ray, Kurosawa, and Ozu; and finally, further European innovations in Antonioni, Varda, the Taviani Bros., Pasolini, et al.

Course participants develop ways of using video's most fundamental property: its ability to reproduce a stream of real-time synchronized images and sounds. How does video technology mediate between on-screen performer and audience? How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"? How can performance artists use video playback devices, displays, projectors, and interactive elements to shape and enhance live art? Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities. The second half of the course concentrates on the use of video as a central component within live art events, plus a continued discussion about the larger cultural and psychological impact of live video production.

        "description": "A survey devoted to the major theories of film from the so-called \"classical period\" (largely the first half of the twentieth century), when both critics and writer/filmmakers were manifestly trying to establish a groundwork for how to think of the relatively new medium of cinema as an expressive form worthy by itself of serious consideration among its more established sister arts. Class discussions will primarily evolve from close readings of sometimes highly complex aesthetic arguments that think through the properties of the medium. We will scrutinize the answers to various questions such as: Can what is deemed \"cinematic\" ever be isolated from other art forms? Can film be thought of as constituting a language? Select film screenings will support our understanding of the written texts. A number of readings will offer a more general philosophical questioning of the nature of art itself, since cinema seems to invite speculation that technology and modern consciousness may have brought dramatically new pressures to bear on aesthetic thinking. Writers to be discussed include C. S. Peirce, Benedetto Croce, Ferdinand de Saussure, Hugo Munsterberg, Erwin Panofsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Rudolf Arnheim, Siefried Kracauer, Maya Deren, Stan Brakhage, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Hollis Frampton, Andrei Tarkovsky, Laura Mulvey, Walter Benjamin, Andre Bazin, Susan Sontag, Gilles Deleuze, Umberto Eco, Christian Metz, et al.

        "description": "This seminar explores the history, theory and practical concerns of film curating , both in and out of the context of the art world. As a way of investigating the range of possibilities for modes of exhibition, the course will look at pre-cinematic technologies of the projected image; various models employed in the silent era; early alternatives to the Hollywood system, including cine-clubs, \"small cinemas,\" road shows, and exploitation; later examples such as cinematheques, film festivals, and microcinemas ; expanded cinema and projection performance; different attempts to introduce film and video into spaces traditionally devoted to visual art; and the role of collections and archives. Individual case studies will include the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Film Library, Amos Vogel\u2019s Cinema 16, Anthology Film Archives, the Collective for Living Cinema, the Whitney Museum\u2019s exhibition Into the Light, and contemporary developments. Coursework will include class presentations, two sets of program notes for imagined film exhibitions, and a final curatorial project. Class size: 8 CCS students, 4 undergraduates. *Note to undergraduates: All interested students must send an email indicating their interest and course experience to the professor in order to be considered (halter@bard.edu).

Furthermore, we will evaluate what happens when the ideological imperatives of a regime transform, fade away, or are suddenly replaced with a new political ideology. Readings include historical, anthropological, and musicological texts that examine the relationship of musical sound to publics, counterpublics and states. Students will produce written works responding to class readings and themes, and develop final projects according to their own research interests. Students do not need to read musical notation to take this class. This course fulfills requirements for the Global and International Studies program and counts towards the moderation requirements in ethnomusicology. Class size: 22",

The backbone of this course will be a detailed in-class analysis of one of Ives\u2019s most iconic works, the Concord Sonata, along with a reading of the book Ives wrote to accompany it, Essays Before a Sonata. We will examine all the manuscripts of the Concord in order to learn as much as we can about Ives\u2019s compositional process. We will also select some other works of Ives\u2019s to analyze in class.

The class will be structured around weekly and bi-weekly assignments that usually begin with an exercise that introduces the class to a medium, technique and set of ideas. Students will work with cardboard, string, found objects and other simple materials to make their three-dimensional artworks. They will then move on to work with mold making and casting, light carpentry and welding. While the department will supply most of the materials for this class, students will be expected to collect some on their own. These materials may come from sources such as the 99-cent store, the fabric store, the free store and the recycling center. Group critiques of projects will be supplemented by demonstrations in materials and techniques, presentations of related modern and contemporary artwork and discussions of readings.",

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves.

This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

We will begin with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, focusing particularly on the understanding of poetry manifest within the world of these poems. Readings from Greek literature will also include lyric poetry (focusing on Sappho and Pindar), and Attic drama (e.g., Aristophane\u2019s Frogs and Clouds, Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound, Euripides\u2019 Medea and Bacchae). Readings from the Latin corpus will include epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry (e.g. Vergil, Horace, Catullus, Seneca). Concurrently, we will be examining the ongoing critique of literature from the fragments of early Greek philosophers (e.g. Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Heraclitus), through Plato and Aristotle, to Cicero and Horace. Our twofold aim will be to develop an understanding of all these texts in their original context and to consider how they set the stage for subsequent developments in western literature and criticism.

The seventeenth century's characteristic figure is Satan struggling against God in Milton's Paradise Lost, but other poets and dramatists like John Donne, Ben Jonson, John Webster, and Andrew Marvell helped to shape the age's passionate interest in the conflict of political, religious, and social ideas and values. After the Civil War and the Puritan rule, monarchy was restored, at least as a reassuring symbol, and writers were free to play up the differences as they did in the witty, bawdy dramatic comedies of the elites and the novels by writers such as Defoe and Fielding which appealed to middle-class readers.

First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future.

Two summary sessions will conclude the semester as we (a) look at the classical heritage of the Iliad (the Aeneid, especially) and then (b) look back at the broad literary and cultural issues raised by this essential document of the Western tradition, and look at some modern adaptations (Logue\u2019s \"War Music,\" for instance; also attempts to dramatize the Iliad\u2014and why they so often fail). A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class. At least three papers, midterm, final exam. This course is designed for First-Year Students. Class size: 16",

Yet he can also be read as a representative of his era, his \"existential anguish\" springing from the very real cultural and historical conflicts that agitated Prague at the turn of the century (e.g. anti-Semitism, contemporary theories of sexuality). The course will cover Kafka\u2019s shorter fiction ranging from fragments, parables and sketches to longer, complete tales (e.g. The Judgment, The Metamorphosis), as well as the novels The Trial and The Man Who Disappeared (Amerika) and excerpts from his diaries and letters. Together they reveal the breath of Kafka\u2019s literary vision and the extraordinary imaginative depth of his thought. Taught in English. Students with an advanced proficiency in German can read selections in the original for extra credit. Class size: 18",

Tracing the stages of conception, research, and composition of Middlemarch and forming as distinct as possible an understanding of the mind of the self-educated, self-created genius, who was born in provincial obscurity as Mary Ann Evans; who wrote her first fiction at age thirty-seven; and who, twelve years later, grown famous (and notorious) as \"George Eliot,\" wrote what many critics consider the greatest novel ever written in English. In a bracing alternative to traditional Victorian novels courses, we will experience George Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch as its first readers did, reading facsimiles of the eight bimonthly \"parts\" complete with advertisements and other ephemera. We will intersperse our reading of the parts over the course of a semester; in the intervals, we will immerse ourselves in the politics, culture, and science of the high Victorian period, an epoch comparable to the Elizabethan era in the richness and variety of its literary production.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies In a 1996 poem titled \"How to Write the Great American Indian Novel,\" Sherman Alexie delivered a series of jabs at the stereotypical Native narrative: \"the hero should often weep alone,\" for instance, while \"A white child and an Indian child, gender / not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.\" The endgame of such a story is, for Alexie, appropriation and genocide: \"all the white people will be Indians and all the Indians will be ghosts.\" The stereotypes are familiar and Alexie\u2019s satire has bite. Yet of course the field of American Indian fiction is in fact remarkably diverse in its tropes and its narrative forms. We will explore that diversity in texts written in English from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Certain concerns will recur, including population displacement, ecological disaster, the politics of religion, and the relationship between orality and print. We will pay equal attention, though, to each writer\u2019s unique approach to the genre of the novel. In doing so we will consider relationships to tradition, both cultural and literary, that exceed the commonplaces Alexie skewers. Authors will include Black Elk, James Fenimore Cooper, Louise Erdrich, D\u2019Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, John Oskison, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Yellow Bird. Class size: 22",

In the Republic, Socrates maintains that courage is one of the four virtues (or excellences) to be found in a good regime and in a good soul. Yet it is not entirely clear from his argument whether courage should be understood the same way in all contexts, and if so, how. Is a warrior\u2019s courage the same as that of a philosopher? Who is truly courageous, the one who defends the regime, the one who questions it, or both? Is the courage of Hektor or Achilles the same as that Socrates or Antigone? In this course, our discussion of courage will proceed through close readings of philosophical texts, both ancient and modern (Plato, Aristotle, Emerson, Tillich, Arendt) and imaginative representations in literature and film (Homer\u2019s Iliad, Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage, Fugard\u2019sThe Island, Zinneman\u2019sHigh Noon, Bertolucci\u2019sThe Conformist). Among other things, we will be asking whether and in what way it makes sense to speak of a single virtue, courage, as being manifest in varying circumstances and in different times and places, and what we may mean today when we characterize a person or an act as courageous.

The gothic novel in America has often confronted topics pertinent to American identity and history. In this course we will examine how many American authors used the gothic genre to actually engage with social, political and cultural concerns.

We will examine how new media interacts with and transforms culture by considering the emergence of digital media in relation to a prior moment of media shift with the explosion of print in eighteenth-century Europe. Exploring how writers and readers responded to the growing influence of print during what we now call the Enlightenment will provide a backdrop for discussing how new media has re-shaped our perception of time, space, publicity, knowledge, and identity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. We will read eighteenth-century writers (Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, and Charlotte Lennox), contemporary fiction writers (Doris Lessing and Neal Stephenson), and key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Fredrick Kittler, Marshall McLuhan, Donna Haraway, and Katherine Hayles). As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. Class size: 22",

First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future. All readings will be in English. This course is a literature junior seminar. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 15",

        "description": "How do we acquire cultural and social capital? What are the subtle mechanisms by which symbolic power is transferred? The books we read, the tastes we acquire, and the ambitions we hold make us into insiders or outcasts, depending on where we stand. Do social structures inevitably reproduce themselves or can we ever hope to start over? Using literary and philosophical texts, this class will explore the tenuous process of passing from one condition to another. Whether this integrative process involves race, country, sexuality, gender, or socio-economics, it explodes the notion of a stable and unchanging self and focuses on border zones of culture and being. We will explore the threatening and liberating resonances of hybrid states and deterritorialized sensibility. Double-consciousness (W.E.B. Du Bois), double temporality (Spinoza), and double diaspora are some terms that will help us study the pain and loss involved in the plasticity of self, in the broken and rebuilt habits at the heart of our desire to be accepted. Readings from Bourdieu'sDistinction, Ranci\u00e8re,The Ignorant Schoolmaster, Nella Larsen,Passing, Henry James,The Europeans,W.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Experimental Humanities We often describe literary form in sonic terms\u2014voice, tone, echo\u2014even as we set the silent, graphic medium of writing in opposition to the noisy, melodious stuff of speech and song. This paradox generates some knotty questions of aesthetics, sensation, and media. Put them in the context of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature, and more arise. In what ways, for instance, does the representation of sound participate in the construction of race, region, and gender? And how do individual artists' approaches to writing sound respond to the development of new recording technologies? This seminar will explore these questions through works of scholarship in literary theory and sound studies; through adaptations that bring texts into other sonic media (phonograph, radio, film); and above all through written works whose expressive contours are shaped by the phenomenon of sound. Readings will likely include texts by Mikhail Bakhtin, Gwendolyn Brooks, George Washington Cable, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, William Faulkner, Lisa Gitelman, Zora Neale Hurston, Tim Ingold, Helen Keller, Friedrich Kittler, Fred Moten, and Susan Stewart. Coursework will include essays in both textual and audio formats. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights What can literature and the arts teach us about evidence? Evidence would seem to be a matter of facts, far from literary or artistic invention. But, whether fact or fiction, we are regularly confronted by all sorts of signs, and we need to learn how to read the traces of things left behind at this or that scene, of a crime for instance. Matters of interpretation, presentation, even rhetoric arise immediately. Evidence, at a minimum, is presented for our deliberation and calls for us to make decisions, form conclusions, or reach judgments. Hence its legal meanings. On the basis of the traces of what has happened \u2014whether in the form of statistics, objects, images, or testimony\u2014we have to decide. This holds even or especially when the evidence seems least equivocal, as in the case of forensics. Sometimes what we see and read seems to compel action, while at other times it appears to immobilize us. As more and more of our world is exposed to view, what becomes of the would-be foundational character of evidence? What is it to ignore evidence? This seminar will explore the theory and practice of evidence, with special attention paid to the different forms evidence can take and the disputes to which it can give rise, especially when violations of, and claims for, human rights are at stake. Readings from Weschler, Felman, Krog, Ondatjie, Latour, Tamen, Azoulay, Didi-Huberman, Morrison, along with a lot of visual material. Class size: 16",

We explore the range and scale of the artistic accomplishments of such masters in these genres as Voltaire, de Maupassant, Leo Tolstoy, Chekhov, Sholem Aleichem, Thomas Mann, Isaac Babel, A. France, Camus, Kafka, Colette, Borges. In addition to writing several analytical papers, students are asked to present a short story or novella of their own by the end of the semester.

The fine (but important) line between factual reportage and fictional imagination will be explored in the work of Ryszard Kapuscinski and Curzio Malaparte.

A master of the aphorism, he believed condensation could penetrate rather than just abbreviate. In this course we will take up the challenge, and practice compression by writing prose that begins and ends on a single page. As poets have always known, brevity is a catalyst to invention. We will focus on the sentence, rather than the line, to investigate exactly how the syntax of narrative and description conveys the movement of thought. Among the short forms we will examine are early and post- modern prose sequences, micro-fictions, guide book entries, capsule reviews, the pr\u00e9cis, the Haibun, the parable, and notebook and journal entries. Among the writers included will be: John Ashbery, Samuel Becket, Thomas Bernhard, Lydia Davis, Russell Edson, Max Jacob, Franz Kafka, Daniil Kharms, Tan Lin, Harry Mathews, Harriett Mullen, Leslie Scalapino, the sinologist Edward Schafer, scent expert Luca Turin, Paul Valery, and Joe Wenderoth.

In this course, we will hopscotch through the history of the profile in English as we attempt to come to an understanding of how a written portrait of a real-live person--Defoe\u2019s profile of the criminal Jack Sheppard, for example--differs in nature and form from a written portrait of an invented person--such as Robinson Crusoe in Defoe\u2019s novel by that name. A writing workshop, this course will be focused, nonetheless, on reading. We will analyze how writers through time who have worked on deadline have managed the formally repetitive task of seizing facts about a person and forging them into a written portrait that offers a distant reader a fair--though sometimes unfair--picture of an individual human being. Readings will be drawn from the history of the practice of journalism of this kind, and will include texts by Defoe, De Quincey, Hazlitt, Rebecca West, George Orwell, Joan Didion, Gay Talese,Janet Malcolm,Henry Louis Gates, Katharine Boo, Jennifer Egan, David Foster Wallace, Leonard Michaels, James Wood, John Jeremiah Sullivan,Rachel Kaadzi Ghansahand others.Students wishing to enroll must contact instructor via email before registration.

Emphasis will be on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This will supplement but never supplant the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) will all contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

After two prefatory sessions, in which students will be introduced to the large issues particular both to this genre (the archaic Greek world, oral composition, the Homeric Question) and to this particular text (the epic cycle, the \"heroic code,\" violence and warfare, the clash of civilizations, East vs. West, the role of the gods in human history), we will read through the epic at a rate of two books per week. Throughout, students will be introduced, by means of excerpts and shorter articles, to the arc of the scholarly tradition, especially with respect to the Homeric Question: from Wolf\u2019s Prolegomenon to Homer to M. L. West\u2019s recent argument that the Iliad was, in fact, written down by a single author/poet. Two summary sessions will conclude the semester as we (a) look at the classical heritage of the Iliad (the Aeneid, especially) and then (b) look back at the broad literary and cultural issues raised by this essential document of the Western tradition, and look at some modern adaptations (Logue\u2019s \"War Music,\" for instance; also attempts to dramatize the Iliad\u2014and why they so often fail). A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class.

We will begin with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, focusing particularly on the understanding of poetry manifest within the world of these poems.

First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future.

We will begin with a historical analysis of the political, socio-economic and cultural reconfigurations that occurred in France and its many colonies from the death knell of the Ancien R\u00e9gime in 1789, through the multifarious wars and revolutions of the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the contemporary Fifth\nRepublic. This historical analysis will provide us with the groundwork for an in-depth reading of today's France and the many challenges it faces: crises of national identity in a postcolonial society, of the maintenance of a social model in the face of globalized economic competition, as well as, perhaps just as importantly, the crisis regarding the quality of the baguettes in one's local boulangerie. Aside from France's infamous pessimism, we will also focus on the seemingly positive aspects of French exceptionalism: the fromage, the fashion, the fact that the works of canonical French authors are bound in books resembling Bibles, and that a certain French president can create a scandal by expressing his dislike for a novel from the 17th century.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature In a rather shocking statement from Le Peuple (1846), the French historian Michelet proclaims that almost all those who benefit from social mobility end up betraying the character and originality of their initial class. \"The hard thing,\" he writes, \"is not [so much] to ascend, but while ascending, to remain oneself.\" What is gained in culture and knowledge, he adds, is lost in \"originality and authentic distinction.\" This seminar will scrutinize novels and essays for their insights about the ways in which various cultural and socio-economic mutations shape and undermine the complex link between distinction and authenticity. It will single out questions of ambition, snobbery, and exclusion through their vocabulary of flattery and contempt. We will examine the psychodynamics of prestige and acceptance, success and failure, as they are crystallized in the deeply antagonistic class relations from Stendhal's Julien Sorel to Eribon's Voyage \u00e0 Reims. We will examine the symbolic violence that marks social cleavages, dwell on Saint-Simon's utopian triad-- avoir/savoir/pouvoir\u2014and use as our model and anti-model the battle between Bourdieu's Habitus and Ranci\u00e8re's dissensus. Readings: Stendhal, Le Rouge et le noir (must be read before classes begin); Balzac, Le P\u00e8re Goriot and excerpts from Illusions perdues; Huysmans, A Rebours; Proust, Un Amour de Swann; Ernaux, La Place, Eribon, Retour \u00e0 Reims.

A date is the temporal center around which a singular work crystallizes. The constellation of dates this course creates will also reflect on pivotal (German) traditions of conceiving history itself (Nietzsche, Benjamin). Readings further include Kant's What is Enlightenment?, Goethe's Faust, B\u00fcchner's Danton\u2019s Death, Rosa Luxemburg's writing on revolution, as well as Hungerangel by the German Nobel Prize winner Herta M\u00fcller.

The course considers major critical approaches (e.g., Freudian, Marxist, feminist) and conducts a contrastive analysis of creative adaptations (Disney, classical ballet, postmodern dance) and other fairy-tale traditions (Perrault, Straparola, Arabian Nights).

Readings will include works by Frank Wedekind, Gottfried Benn, Georg Heym, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Kafka, Georg Kaiser, and Georg Trakl. Since Expressionism involved not just literature but painting, music, and film, we will also consider works by the Br\u00fccke- and Blaue Reiter-associations of painters, Alban Berg\u2019s opera Wozzeck, and films such as Der letzte Mann, M, and Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies Italy has not one, but many capitals. Unlike other European countries, there is no central stage in the construction of national culture that can boast hegemonic influence throughout Italian history. Although the myth of Rome and its imperial past fostered literati\u2019s dreams of political grandeur, Italy grounds its multifold identity on the difference and peculiarities of cities such as Florence, Venice, Naples and Milan. Living, walking, and imagining the city is a key experience for Italian culture, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, to the Postmodern. With a multidisciplinary approach from poetry to visual arts, the course draws from the works of authors such as Dante, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Marinetti, Pasolini, Calvino and Elena Ferrante. This course constitutes a first introduction to Italian civilization for students who have completed the language sequence, and offers an opportunity for them to hone their skills before they enroll in an upper-college seminar. Prerequisites: Italian 202, or permission of the instructor. Conducted in Italian. ",

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior. Open to First-Year students only. ",

In addition to discussions of the molecular mechanisms involved in DNA replication, recombination, the generation and repair of mutations, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype, special consideration is given to our understanding of the processes involved in generating population-level variation in complex traits and how this understanding can help us identify the myriad genetic and non-genetic factors influencing these traits.

We will consider how research on ordinary human tendencies can help us answer questions such as: Why are we more likely to mistakenly \"see\" a weapon in the hand of an African-American than a European-American? How and why does sentencing differ based on racial factors? How do deliberations differ based on a jury\u2019s racial composition? Broadly, we will grapple with how to reconcile legal doctrine that often demands evidence of conscious, deliberate intent to discriminate or harm with empirical data showing that behavior often operates outside of our awareness, and without intention or control.

This settlement began in 1710 as the first substantial German-speaking community in the New  World. Recent evidence indicates that Native Americans visited the minister\u2019s home (or Parsonage) before 1750, and that African Americans lived at the site by the early 1800s, if not decades earlier. The Mohicans likely came from their last village in New York, a German mission in the Taconic hills east of Bard. After a mass emigration from the Rhineland Palatinate and two years of forced labor conditions in Germantown, a robust economy began to grow in the central Hudson Valley around orchards and animal husbandry and has lasted almost three centuries. In the mid-1800s, several African American families established a neighborhood near the old village center and left traces of their own spiritual practices, possibly from their enslaved ancestors. We\u2019ll read background texts and write short papers for weekly seminar, and do 4.5-hour excavation and/or lab sessions on Friday [or weekend afternoons before mid-term]. Class size: 12",

We will survey and critique traditional methods of ethnographic engagement such as participant-observation, interviews, archival research, visual, sonic and textual analysis, and address the challenges of doing fieldwork in a variety of contexts, including the virtual domain. Intensive writing exercises will raise important questions about how ethnographic research can be ethically and effectively \"translated\" into written text.

In the 1980s and 90s, as Japanese economic power and cultural influence grew worldwide, the nation's status as a global force was established beyond question. In more recent years, however, specters of economic recession, disenchanted youth, aging population, and nuclear disaster have produced new conditions of precarity, reconfiguring experiences and meanings of contemporary life. By focusing on such key transitions over the past seven decades, this course will offer an introduction to changing social, economic, and political formations in Japan from an anthropological perspective. Readings will include ethnographic works on economic recovery in the post-war period, gender in office politics, schools and disciplinary tactics, the culture of cuteness, delayed marriage and divorce, homelessness, and institutionalized care for the elderly. The final section of the course will explore transnational dimensions of Japan in a global context, including the aspirations of Japanese women abroad, and the globalization of popular culture genres such as anime.

We will be particularly concerned with issues of identity, empowerment, and appropriation. In this light will explore the religious and symbolic dimensions of these religions, from those that claim African orthodoxy to those that have embraced innovation and heterodoxy, and their sociopolitical structures. Issues concerning the race, class, gender, and politics of the leaders who guide these religions and the followers attracted to them will be examined in relation to the degree to which such affiliations may strengthen African identities and foster movements for cultural and racial political empowerment or may represent appropriations of the African heritage serving the interests of dominant groups. Throughout, the class will be attentive to the ways in which these religions are represented in ethnography and film.

It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

Drawing on ethnographic and historical readings from a number of disparate geographical locales (e.g. Japan, Ukraine, India, Palestine, South  Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, France, Venezuela, the United States, the United Arab Emirates) we will start by asking when, and with what consequences, infrastructures become visible or invisible. The course will be organized thematically around different types of infrastructure present in modern colonial and postcolonial contexts. These will include roads, water distribution networks, landfills, sewage pipelines, electricity, telecommunications, nuclear energy stations and mass media forms such as radio and television. We will explore how infrastructures become central to popular claims to rights, how they shape senses and sensibilities and how they shape relationships between the body and the public (the \"body politic\"). We will investigate how marginalized groups may reappropriate dominant infrastructures, for example, such that the \"messages\" infrastructures convey and the material effects they produce may be transformed. Climate change scientists increasingly have the ear of governments and multinational corporations. We will thus also consider how climate change \"adaptation\" and emissions reductions strategies through new large-scale infrastructures are producing new discourses around environmental security and new ways of imagining the future of human existence.

How do surveillance practices secure or undermine state sovereignty and citizen solidarity in a digital age? This course will look at a variety of surveillance techniques, ranging from low-tech forms of social surveillance to state and corporate surveillance in visual, audio, and digital forms. Drawing on ethnographic, artistic, and theoretical works, we will consider the importance of visual media to enhance state or corporate power/knowledge over citizens and workers. We will also study the uses of sound technology for surveillance purposes, from Anathasius Kircher\u2019s 17th century listening tubes to 20th century telephone wiretapping (a metaphor now used to also describe monitoring digital data). Acoustic surveillance intervenes in human beings\u2019 most primary form of social communication - talking and listening \u2013 and draws our attention to the ways that social groups monitor themselves through practices like gossip and rumor. Surveillance is therefore not only related to the power of corporations or governments, but also gets at the heart of what it means to be social beings who constantly monitor each other and ourselves with or without technology. The course will traverse practices of surveillance in different parts of the globe and from both sides of the \"digital divide\" - from informal informants who spy on fellow refugees in Italy, to police surveillance in Gaza, to hacker groups like Anonymous or Wikileaks, or Snowden's exposure of the NSA, to more public citizen campaigns like #wearewatchingyou that also target state surveillance practices. As a student-generated Experimental Humanities course, this class will require significant participation on the part of the students to research a specific surveillance practice over the course of the semester and design their own experimental projects based around their research and our readings.

Practices of both collection and display have been central to the imagining and valuing of various kinds of cultural others, and to the construction and communication of knowledge about the world\u2019s peoples. This course will examine multiple historical and theoretical points of articulation (and disarticulation) between the museum and the discipline of anthropology. Topics include: the place of the \"exotic\" curio in early European and colonial collections; the rise of natural history and social evolutionary paradigms for exhibiting non-Western objects and people; the development of professional anthropology in the museum; popular forms of ethno-spectacle (e.g. the world\u2019s fair, cinema, and commercial culture) and the lasting tension between education and entertainment; debates surrounding \"primitivism\" and avant-garde interest in non-Western art; nationalism, sovereignty, and repatriation in the wake of decolonization; and contemporary anthropological and ethnographic studies of museums as sites of cultural production and contest. Through critical readings, discussions, and a visit to museums in New York City, students will come to better understand and appreciate the dynamics of collecting, studying, and displaying the art and material culture of the world\u2019s peoples.

The microeconomics component of the course develops the basic model of consumer and firm behavior, including demand and supply, in the context of an idealized competitive market and examines several ways in which the real world deviates from this model\u2014including monopoly and other forms of imperfect competition; information problems; minimum wages and other price controls; taxes; and government regulation. The macroeconomics component studies the aggregate behavior of modern economies - the factors leading to economic growth, explanations of booms and recessions, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and budget deficits or surpluses \u2013 and the government\u2019s ability (or inability) to use monetary and fiscal policies to achieve economic goals such as full employment and price stability.

In it, students will get acquainted with main models that macroeconomists use to analyze the way economies behave. The course starts by looking at the models that explain long run economic growth. We then focus our attention on investigating economic theories that explain short run business cycles, the periods of recessions and booms that occur on a regular basis. An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries. We apply the acquired theoretical knowledge to a range of current economic issues, including budget deficits and national debt, international trade, and the role of institutions.

The concept of economic development is defined and related to ideas such as economic growth, sustainable development and human development. Economic theories of development are introduced, and policies designed to promote development at the local, national and international levels are evaluated. Considerable attention is paid to understanding how household decisions in rural agricultural societies are shaped by the institutional and policy environments. Topics include the economic consequences of colonialism and economic dependence; poverty and income distribution; investments in physical and human capital; economic aspects of household choices such as schooling, and fertility; rural-urban transformation; the effects of trade, industrial and agricultural policies; the role of foreign capital flows; political economy aspects of development policy; population growth and the environment; gender and development.

Since Adam Smith, economists have used different assumptions, models and methodologies to study the role of markets, states, and institutions in the process of social provisioning. This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world.

We ask: How did towns change and a middle class emerge in western Europe; how did capitalist cultures develop, then link East and West; how did universities complement or challenge the status quo in Europe; how did political patronage sustain ancient philosophy in the Muslim world; how did power and religious ideology affect political spheres; how did medieval climate, technology, and epidemic transform Asia, the Middle East, and Europe? Our primary sources are literary, political, and philosophical. We examine: polemical writings about power and justice; Muslim and Jewish philosopher-theologians, whose work inspired their Christian counterparts; and the legend of The Cid, a complex hero, reimagined during the 12th-century Iberian reconquista, in a Spanish vernacular masterpiece of epic poetry.

Kennan observed in 1945. \"Of course I am. What do people expect? God forbid that we should be without an elite. Is everything to be done by gray mediocrity?\" This course examines the foreign policy intellectual elite that Kennan both admired and personified, including the likes of Alfred Mahan, Woodrow Wilson, Charles Beard, Walter Lippmann, Paul Nitze, Henry Kissinger, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Francis Fukuyama, Paul Wolfowitz, and Samantha Power. Each in varying ways shaped and dominated the discourse and practice of U.S. foreign affairs, including judgments about the usefulness of history itself as a tool for decision making. In their debates and disagreements about America\u2019s evolving role as the world's No. 1 power, each thinker, in the words of historian David Milne, \"consciously engaged in a process of worldmaking,\" formulating strategies to deploy vast military and economic power--or its retraction--to protect U.S. permanent interests.

It focuses largely on France, Britain, and America. However, students will be encouraged to think comparatively and globally. We will consider the development of the police as an expression of sovereign right and of citizens\u2019 rights, from enforcer of the king\u2019s will to public servant. Changing ideas of security and order not only undergird the history of the police but have developed through police practices. We will observe how resistance to diverse forms of policing entered into civil and human rights discourses almost from the start. The course is organized chronologically and around public space: the market, food security, and price regulation; the port and contraband; the urban street, vice, and violence; the road, highwaymen, and runaway slaves; the public housing project and domestic violence; the neighborhood and resistance to policing; and from the more abstract sites of early international cooperation to state and international investigative agencies, such as the FBI, MI 6, and Interpol. In these spaces, we study the vulnerabilities of individual bodies and social groups, including those of the police. We study vulnerabilities that resulted from the institutional growth of the police, especially in its powers to identify, classify, and contain mobile populations and commit acts of violence with legitimacy. Today, many police departments include \"courage\" in their mission statements, accepting that the job requires their members throw themselves bodily into high-risk situations. Members of marked populations describe as \"courageous\" activities that unmarked populations take as commonplace or as their right, from walking in a different neighborhood to raising children. Beyond bold acts in the service of order or outstanding acts of opposition, we will consider how the policed world incited and incites everyday forms of courage, contributing to ideas of citizenship and personhood.

While colonial authorities used the radio to broadcast news reports and to internally transmit governing strategies, local African communities sometimes appropriated the radio for both political and entertainment purposes. This course uses the technological history of the radio in Africa to explore histories of political activism, leisure, cultural production and entertainment across Sub-Saharan Africa from colonial to present times. From a topical perspective, the course will cover the development of radio stations and distribution markets, the politics of programming and censorship, international development agencies\u2019 push for community radio, and radio dramas. Using theoretical texts on sound, affect and oral tradition, students will identify different cultures of listening with the aim of unpacking what it means to use words and music in order to \"broadcast\" history. As a final project and in conjunction with the Human Rights Program\u2019s Radio Initiative, students will design a podcast on a topic of historical relevance to the course. Class size: 22",

For each celebrated achievement -- pastoralism, agriculture, steam power, and so on -- there has been a price to pay. W. H. McNeill traces the toll of agriculture, for example, on human health in a world where living things compete for water. His son, J. R. McNeill, examines how electricity and the combustion engine have contaminated air, water, and earth. Numerous studies correlate dams with reduced salmon spawning, reservoirs with more rapid evaporation of water, and pesticides with extinctions and mutations. The list is long enough to warrant the dissident new historiography we tamely call environmental history.

The history of the theater, therefore, is inextricably connected with the history of how societies have performed conquest, colonialism, and cultural patrimony in different parts of the world. This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

As powerful and widespread as these experiences were, the global history of slavery is broader. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was not alone in the early modern period. Millions of Africans were enslaved and forced to covert to Islam in an eastern-oriented trade, alongside Slavs and Caucasians. Their experiences ran the gamut of alienated labor up to occupying the most prestigious positions within the imperial army and administration of the Ottoman Empire, the longest lasting Islamic empire in history (ca.1300-1922). Taking the experiences of Ottoman slaves as a starting point, this seminar explores the identities, trajectories and afterlives of slaves in the Middle East (very broadly defined to include North Africa, the Balkans and the Caucasus) during the early modern and modern periods. The seminar's main topics include: the recruitment, training and careers of slaves; the everyday life of slaves; the trade networks that enabled the displacement of slaves; the paradoxical role of European colonialism in ending slavery; the memory of slavery and its influence on postcolonial societies; and the reemergence of new forms of slavery in today's Middle East.

This course introduces students to the practice of philosophy through sustained engagement with its ancient origins. We will begin with a discussion of the figure of Socrates, the paradigmatic ancient philosopher, including his disavowal of knowledge, his method of dialogue, his public trial, and his exemplary death. The second part of the course will focus on the two most significant thinkers in the classical period of philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, and on close examination of their philosophical arguments about the nature of knowledge, the powers of the soul, and the highest goal of life. We will conclude with a discussion of the profound critiques of classical philosophy developed by the major philosophical schools in post-classical Greece and Rome, including Cynicism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Skepticism. This course is open to all undergraduates and assumes no prior knowledge of philosophy. Class size: 22",

An ancient tradition claims that we have a detailed set of inborn capabilities and limitations, rich in implications for how we can live our lives and organize society. An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are? We will investigate these and other questions in the course through an interdisciplinary mix of readings from philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and other fields. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Political Studies According to Aristotle\u2019s Politics, \"a state is among the things that exist by nature.\" In Aristotle\u2019s view, it is natural for human beings to live together in a political community, since it is only in a political community that human beings are fully capable of living well. In modern times, however, this ancient view of the state has come to seem doubtful and even dangerous. For many modern thinkers \u2013 beginning with Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century \u2013 the state is anything but natural. It is at best a useful artifice designed to keep the peace among naturally conflicting interests, and at worst a monstrous fraud whereby those in power oppress their subjects in the name of the \"common good\". This difference between ancient and modern views of the state has profound implications for a series of fundamental questions in political theory: what is a political community? How can political authority be legitimate? Is disobedience or revolution against the existing authorities ever justified? If so, when? This course introduces students to the philosophical tradition of reflection on these questions through reading, discussing, and writing about classic works of political theory from antiquity to the present. The course is designed for sophomores and juniors who want to deepen their interest in political philosophy and to reflect on the foundations of their own political engagement. In addition to Aristotle and Hobbes, our primary readings will come from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. First-year students may apply. Class size: 22",

The dominant trend in contemporary philosophy of mind is to pursue these questions in close alliance with empirical sciences, such as psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The result is typically a mechanistic and reductive picture of the mind, one on which the mind is just one arena among many in which causal factors operate to produce effects. However, some philosophers question whether a mechanistic picture of the mind can adequately accommodate our first person perspective, that is, what it feels like from the inside to have a mind and navigate the world with it. In this course, we will address the question of whether mechanistic accounts of the mind can accommodate our first person perspective by focusing on three main topics: the qualitative or phenomenological dimension of experience; our knowledge of our own attitudes; and our engagement in mental action.

Thus the two texts, so different in style, tone, and narrative arc, are not only in conversation with each other but literally open up into each other. We will pay close attention to such themes as perspectivism, literary experimentalism, philosophy (and life) as art, the diagnosis of modernity as cultural nihilism, the recovery of the body, the central role of the unconscious, and the concepts of the will to power, the revaluation of values, the overman, and the death of god.

Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change?

Following a brief introduction to core concepts of American global strategy, students will dig into the Burma situation, exploring the many factors that policymakers must take into account including the regime's motivations and policies, the internal situation in Burma from the political and economic points of view, the role of external actors like China and of international bodies such as the IMF and the UN, and the nature of American interests and humanitarian concerns. Readings, lectures and conversations with a variety of experts will give students a sound foundation from which to understand both the forces at work and the nature of American debate about policy options. With this background, students will look at current US policy and the leading alternatives. In their final paper, students will be challenged to apply the skills and insights they have developed in the course to proposing an American strategy for Burma. The final paper for the course will be 8 pages in length: 5 pages of analysis and three pages to describe an American strategy. Class size: 30",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature Since the development of mass culture, political and aesthetic thinkers have questioned how it is possible for us to be part of massive institutional structures such as state bureaucracy, the market, and education without compromising what it means to be a self. In order to be someone, we might wager, we must be both separate and together, participate in recognizing others and recede from the world in solitude. Yet today, subjectivity appears to pertain to what we buy rather than to who we are as personalities. Personal conviction can thus be immobilized by an overwhelming feeling of uncertainty: Who am I? What do I stand for and why does it matter? At the same time, such insecurities may be employed to fuel the political and literary imagination and envision new ways of being in the world. This course will turn to writers including Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Walter Benjamin, Jean Am\u00e9ry, and Hannah Arendt to explore different answers to the question of selfhood as both an ethical and aesthetic problem in a mass society. After considering some of the theoretical foundations of modern subjectivity, we will investigate what emerges as (or remains of) selfhood after the large-scale degradation of human beings in the two world wars. The course will ask how writers and thinkers reconceive of the idea of subjectivity precisely through its crisis. As examples, we will look at some paradigmatic \"lost\" subjects of the postwar period such as Kafka\u2019s protagonists, the \"schizophrenic\" child (Bruno Bettelheim), and the disenchanted stranger (Camus). This course is part of the College Seminar \"The Courage to Be.\" It is open to Sophomores and Juniors and is limited to 16 students. Students are required to attend three evening lectures on Mondays from 6-8. There will also be dinner discussions with guest speakers and students from other sections of the College Seminar.

The first explores the philosophical foundations of the notion of human rights and its contested universality, and the historical developments that propelled human rights to the forefront of international politics, especially the atrocities of World War II committed by Germany's Nazi regime.The second part of the course focuses on the evolution of the so-called \"international human rights regime,\" or the main actors and institutions in the human rights arena responsible for promoting and policing human rights--from the basic legal framework of human rights (the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights), to major multilateral human rights institutions, such as the UN Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court, and the European Court of Human Rights, to prominent non-state actors such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and the International Center for Transitional Justice. The third part examines the evolution of human rights, especially the shifts from \"first generation\" human rights (political freedoms) to \"second generation\" human rights (social and economic rights, such as housing, employment, and education), to \"third generation human rights\" and beyond (cultural self-determination, economic sustainability, and sexual freedoms, among others); and the means by which these shifts have come about andhavespreadaround the globe, such as international socialization,globalization, and policy diffusion.

We will begin by examining the interdisciplinary literature on gender theory and applying its insights to international politics. What does it mean to conduct a \"gendered analysis\" of global affairs? How do gendered discourses produce our understanding of what is and is not understood as a national security problem? Why has traditional security studies failed to incorporate gender into its analysis? Then, we apply these theoretical frameworks to important security issues such as,the cultural effects of nuclear weapons, the targeting of civilians during armed conflict, sexual violence in war, torture and the war on terrorism, nationalism and the state, human security and development, and post-conflict societies, to name a few. Throughout, the gendered nature of security issues will be explored from multi-disciplinary perspectives drawn from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, politics and rhetoric in order to highlight the complex interconnections among states, societies and individuals. Historical and contemporary case studies will be drawn from a number of countries across the globe. In reexamining key concepts in the study of international politics\u2014namely, sovereignty, the state and insecurity\u2014this course has two goals. First, to expose how gendered discourses of security that focus on the state render invisible a multitude of threats to individual security. Second, to question the role of the state as a security provider by highlighting the insecurities individuals and societies experience as a consequence of state-centered national security policy.

This course aims to unpack the historical and ideological roots of this conflict; how it has developed over the course of at least two centuries, and what possibilities exist for its resolution in the future. The course is divided into three main sections. The first one covers the years between 1830-1940, and emphasizes American attempts to establish economic hegemony across Latin America and military interventions designed to export democratic government and Latin American responses to what was perceived as an imperial and/or colonial American project. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War as played out throughout Latin America between the years of 1940-1990. It emphasizes the real and perceived fears by US policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to several interventions and covert actions; and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon Latin America. The third and final section looks at the most salient issues in US-Latin American relations in the post-Cold War years, especially economic integration, narco-trafficking, immigration, and the war on terror.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights (core course) When should states use military force to alleviate human suffering? Does the need to intervene to stop human rights violations outweigh the right of states to maintain control over territory? The international states system is built upon the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention. Yet over the past two decades human rights have emerged as an increasingly accepted justification legitimizing the use of force. This apparent tension between the respect for state sovereignty and the inevitable violations that result from the use of military force for humanitarian purposes is at the center of the debate over human rights in the field of international relations. This course explores the dilemmas and controversies surrounding the use of force for humanitarian purposes. The first part examines the major ethical, political and strategic arguments for and against humanitarian military intervention. The second part focuses on specific instances where states undertook, or failed to undertake, a humanitarian military intervention (for example, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Sudan, Libya and Syria, among others). Through an examination of particular case studies, we will better understand why the international community has such an inconsistent record of stopping humanitarian crises and what the limitations and possibilities of human rights are in international politics.

We are facing in the United States and around the world a radical loss of political legitimacy. It is periods like these when political power is diminished that the possibility of new political systems has emerged. These are revolutionary times. But what is a revolution? And what makes a successful revolution? At root, a revolution requires revolutionaries, those who not only courageously risk their lives but also have the courage to think new thoughts and dream new dreams. But something more is required. According to Hannah Arendt, successful revolutions constitute freedom. It is not surprising that in her book \"On Revolution\" Arendt has two long chapters on the American Constitution. This short course (2 credits) asks the question, what is the role of the American Constitution in the American Revolution. Our principle text will be Hannah Arendt\u2019s book \"On Revolution\" and we will focus on the Constitutional aspects of Arendt\u2019s argument.

The songs, legends, and theologies of these saints and the communities they established permeate the religious life of India. This course explores the world of bhakti through its poetry. We examine issues of poetics and theology, bhakti and opposition to orthodox social conventions, bhakti and gender, the interactions of Hindu devotionalism and Islamic Sufism, the role of bhakti in Indian music, and the problem of bhakti in twentieth-century Indian literature. This is a writing intensive course. The general goals of the writing component of the course are to improve the development, composition, organization, and revision of analytical prose; the use of evidence to support an argument; strategies of interpretation and analysis of texts; and the mechanics of grammar and documentation.

And except for those forms of Buddhism that continued in northern India before finally disappearing around the thirteenth century, all Buddhist communities have been separated from the geographical origin of Buddhism by space. In this course we will look at how Buddhist communities have attempted to bridge this gap between themselves and the origin of their tradition by examining Buddhist conceptions of history, on the one hand, and Buddhist visions of the geographical layout of the Buddhist world, on the other. We will focus on Buddhist historiographical works and legends to better understand Buddhist historical thought, while early Buddhist maps will aid us in understanding how certain Buddhist communities understood their geographical positions vis-\u00e0-vis other communities, real or imagined. For purposes of comparison we will also be reading about historical and geographical thought as found in other religious traditions. Class size: 17",

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Psychology It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with only slight modifications, and with concordant resultswas published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence and remarkable is that fact that a new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) is about to be released. In addition, a diligentsearch of current psychology or cross disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedienceand indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960sandstretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size 10 \u2013 12.",

At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

The course is organized according to different institutional and interactional contexts, including families, workplaces, schools, the state & politics, sexuality, culture, and identity.Our discussions will be guided by both theoretical approaches to gender and a variety of empirical research. A second goal of this course is to become familiar with various sociological theories of gender difference and inequality. A third goal is to learn how gender inequality is intertwined with other axes of power such as race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality and how to conduct such \"intersectional\" analysis of social life. In addition, students will learn to identify and evaluate various forms of sociological evidence and arguments. Class size: 22",

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

The course thus introduces many enduring themes of sociology: alienation and anomie; social structure and disorganization; group conflict and solidarity; secularization and individualism; bureaucracy and institutions, the division of labor, capitalism, and the nature of authority. We then follow these conversations into the contemporary era, examining traditions such as functionalism, conflict theory, rational choice, symbolic interactionism, feminist theory, and critical theory, including thinkers such as G.H. Mead, Robert Merton, Pierre Bourdieu, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault. Students will learn the key concepts of major theoretical approaches in sociology, and will consider questions such as the relationship between theory and research, and the relationship of social conditions to the production of knowledge.

The amount and type of punishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of punishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

These are profoundly social issues as well. This course uses examples such as food systems, fracking, health disparities, and natural disasters to critically assess the relationship between society and the environment at local and global scales. In doing so, we cover four topics that are central to environmental sociology. First, the course explores how people collectively understand and frame environmental issues. Second, we examine how social structures, political and economic institutions, and individual human actions shape and disrupt the natural environment. Third, we analyze the social consequences of a changing natural world, focusing on the unequal distribution of the benefits and burdens of environmental change. Finally, students will critically examine the ways that scholars, policymakers, and citizens are responding to the many contemporary environmental challenges. Class size: 22",

This will help us to see how classical sociological thinkers \u2013 especially Marx, Weber, and Durkheim \u2013 drew on legal concepts and traditions in formulating their theories of social order (and disorder). Shifting from a historical perspective to a more holistic and contemporary perspective, we will study the myriad ways in which law is impacting, and is impacted by, the social forces of the modern world. We will focus especially on the role that law plays in making modern, industrialized capitalism possible.

Taken together, these two groups today comprise between a fifth and a quarter of all Americans. Although they have had very different histories, it is common to think that both groups are especially concentrated in the bottom rungs of socio-economic wellbeing. And we will consider what life at the bottom rungs means in each group. But we will spend more than half the course exploring the experiences of those in each group who live above the lowest socio-economic rungs. How large a fraction are these more fortunate families in each group? How secure are they in their distance from poverty? What can we say about where they live, how they work, their education, lifestyles? Of special interest will be the prevalence (high or low) of inter-racial and inter-ethnic families; this can be a telling indicator of how separate a group is from the rest of society. Throughout, we will try to keep in mind three kinds of comparisons: African-American to Mexican American, higher to lower class within each group, and comparisons of each group to the Euro-American (\u2018white\u2019) Americans.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender and Sexuality Studies; Human Rights This seminar uses gender as a lens to approach the sociological field of \"deviance and social control.\" It will develop your understanding of different theoretical approaches to deviance and to gender. The course considers the relationship between gender and definitions of what is normal, sick, and criminal and investigates how norms about masculinity and femininity can produce specifically gendered types of deviance. We will learn about the role of gender in why and how people break rules, looking at both criminal and non-criminal deviance. We will then explore how social institutions construct and enact forms of regulation, punishment, or treatment. The course asks how responses to rule-breaking relate to the social organization of gender and sexuality. To help answer these questions, the course will continually ask how these processes intersect with race and class inequality. The course looks at both formal and informal responses to deviance, and considers their role in gender, class, and race inequality more broadly. The last half of the course examines major areas of gendered deviance, such as sex work, sexual violence, and the medicalization of deviance. Throughout, the course considers the ways that gendered social control both limits and creates possibilities for action and how individuals use gender to make rule-breaking meaningful.

It will include a review of some current and historical public health problems, such as tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS, small pox, maternal and infant mortality and reproductive health and rights, and the approaches used to understand and address them. Students will also examine the roles of a range of international organizations involved in global public health efforts, including local and international non-governmental organizations, multilateral agencies such as the WHO, UNAIDS, bilateral organizations like the CDC and USAID, governments and donor organizations. The course aims to convey an understanding of the complexity of health problems in developing countries, the impact of health on social and economic development, the contributions of various disciplines and analytical perspectives in decision-making about public health priorities, and the range of players that contribute to developing and implementing the programs to address them. The course will be structured primarily around a series of case studies of public health policies and practices around which there has been controversy or debate about the appropriate course of action. The case studies will include a major focus on HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health, and will examine such issues as quarantine, testing of new technologies on vulnerable populations, commitment of resources to treatment versus prevention, and the influence of conflicting \"moralities\" on public health program approaches. These debates will examine the tensions that sometimes arise between efforts to ensure public health and safety, while promoting health equity and rights. It will incorporate perspectives of stakeholders in the developing world, as well as scientists, policy makers and activists. The analysis and readings will draw from various disciplines, including epidemiology and medical anthropology. Class size: 15",

On one level, this means that it is about something you do yourself all the time -- but we will be looking specifically at how analysis is produced for those who work in both the public and the private sectors and face critical political, investment, or even humanitarian decisions. Concentrating on three crucial components \u2013 collection, analysis and communications \u2013 the goal is understand processes behind the production of good analysis and the ways in which it can be conveyed to decision makers. At the same time as intensively studying some of the instances in which intelligence analysis has resulted in success -- and, because it tends to be more revealing, those where it has not -- we will be trying out some of the techniques involved in professional analysis, including writing, presentations, and team work, and looking at analysts working in the government, financial, and non-profit sectors. The intention is to offer an appreciation of what professional analysts do in an intelligence and political risk context, and how their work can feed into the conduct of international relations and international business.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies This course will address the history of modern architecture from its emergence in Western Europe during the eighteenth century through to its widespread presence and diversification by the end of World War II. The course will pay particular attention to the ways in which architects have responded to, and participated in, formal and aesthetic developments in other arts, as well as the role of architecture in broader technological, economic, and social-political transformations. Covering many aspects of architecture from buildings, drawings, models, exhibitions, and schools, to historical and theoretical writings and manifestoes we will investigate a range of modernist practices, polemics, and institutions. The readings, both primary and secondary texts, have been selected both to provide an overview of the history of modern architecture and to offer a number of critical and historical approaches to evaluating its legacy. Figures discussed include Schinkel, Paxton, Sullivan, Wright, Oud, Corbusier, Mies, and Aalto. Requirements include two short written assignments, a midterm, and a final exam. No prerequisites.

This means looking at, analyzing, talking about, and writing about visual images, including art works, film, television, advertising, and other modes of visual culture. The term \"visual culture\" has a double sense: first, it can mean the actual visual materials produced in a given place and time, and it can also mean the way in which we are enculturated (trained by our culture or society) to read images. We'll spend the semester thinking about and comparing different types of visual communications, and thinking about the many ways one can interpret their messages-and the reasons why their meanings shift from context to context.Our thinking and reading brings together philosophies of art, communication, and media studies, as well as the history of art.Assignments and Exams: midterm and final exams; four short papers and generous participation in discussion.Class size: 22",

Behind each of these specific measuring devices is a culture of production that informed its making or the map images produced by these tools. This course is a critical examination of the visual history and cultural production of maps as various discourses of power, nation building, identity formation, and economics. Foundations for the class are built on texts written by geographers, sociologists, and urban or art historians such as J. B. Harley, Dennis Cosgrove, David Buissert, Henri Lefebvre, and Edward Soja as well as authors who theorize the future production of maps using digital technologies. From prehistoric cave drawings to spatial history digital projects, topics will include mapmaking traditions in Western Europe, ancient and medieval China, Islamic Central and South Asia, pre-contact America, as well as the intersection of these practices and the application of digital mapping within this history. Short writing assignments will complement individual and collaborative digital projects aimed at gaining a familiarity with different methods of mapping. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross listed: Photography; Human Rights; Science, Technology & Society In the decades after World War II, photography\u2019s social and artistic roles changed in many ways. The 1950s saw the dominance of magazine photography in Life and Look and witnessed the birth of a more personal photographic culture, exemplified by Robert Frank\u2019s book The Americans. In the 1960s and 1970s, photographers such as Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, and Lee Friedlander created a new view of contemporary life from moments gathered in the streets and from private lives. Beginning in the late 70s, artists trained outside of traditional photography began to employ the camera for wholly different purposes, using photography to pose ideological questions about images and image-making in a media-saturated culture. Today, the transformation of photography through digital technology has again thrown the meaning(s) of photographically-derived images into question. This lecture/discussion class will cover the historical context of this period and tease out fundamental issues of photography and its ostensible nature and the politics of representation. Student performance will be evaluated in class discussion, exams, and papers. No prerequisites, but preference will be given to moderated photography and moderated art history students.

We will pursue relevant questions such as: what exactly are the criteria for inclusion in such categories, do art markets drive this labeling, how does this work function within the art world, are categorical borders crossed in order to fit the needs of exhibiting institutions, and finally how has Outsider Art impacted mainstream modern and contemporary art and are the dividing lines between the two still relevant? We will look at artwork produced within certain institutional settings such as mental asylums and prisons, as well as that produced by mediums, spiritualists and other \"visionaries\" working within what can be best described as a \"folk art\" category.

Is it possible to create a new kind of dance product or new danceknowledge? What happens when we make work from a space of curious unknowing instead of confident knowing? In Comp III, we will investigate how we can reimaginethe creative process in order to surprise ourselves with what it produces. We will draw from the movement-based ideas generated by philosophy, cultural studies, as well asdance makers past and present to generate our own processes and questions.We'll also explore the importance of working in other creative forms (primarily visual arts) as a way to increase our understanding of our primary art form (dance, movement). Essential to our trajectory will be an increase in our dance literacy: our ability to see and speak about dance in its own milieu as well as understand its implications for and relevance to larger cultural contexts.

The course will focus on a relatively small number of major filmmakers: the early pioneers of the 1940s (Deren, Peterson, Menken, and Broughton); the mythopoeic artificers of the 1950's and early 1960's (Anger, Brakhage, and Baillie); and the formalists of the late 1960s, (Frampton, Snow and Gehr). We will also pay attention to the strong graphic/collage cinema of artists like Cornell, Conner, Smith, and Breer as well as to the anarchic, comic improvisations of figures like Jacobs, Kuchar, and MacLaine. We will end in the mid 1970's by touching on the movement's then future prospects, e.g. the revitalization of storytelling through autobiography (Mekas) and feminist/critical narrative (Rainer). Supplementary readings, including many theoretical works by the filmmakers themselves as well as material touching on parallel avant-garde movements in painting, photography, poetry, and music from the same era, works by highly influential artists like Charles Olson, John Cage, et al.

DeMille, Len Lye, Michael Powell, Douglas Sirk, Stan Brakhage, Michelangelo Antonioni, Derek Jarman, Claire Denis, Aleksandr Sokurov, and Jia Zhang-ke; painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Henri Matisse, and Mark Rothko; and photographers such as Edward Steichen. Readings will include essays by artists, critical texts, and theoretical works by figures such as Goethe, Wasily Kandinsky, and Josef Albers. Grades based on in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and a final research essay. Moderated film and art history students will have priority. Class size: 12",

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 15",

We will look at form and orchestration, but mostly we will be involved with Roman numeral analysis of augmented sixth chords, borrowed chords, enharmonic modulations, and chromatic voice-leading, applying Neo-Riemannian techniques where appropriate. More compositionally, we will study the wealth of thematic transformation techniques that made late Romanticism such a fluid and often extramusically referential language. Primary grading points will be two analysis papers (10 pages each) and two composition projects, plus occasional smaller assignments, along with active participation in class analyses.

This course will introduce the language of contemporary sculpture through building objects and installations, looking at slides and videos, drawing, writing, verbal critique and discussion. We will explore how meaning is communicated through sculpture, using a variety of materials such as wood, fabric, clay, metal and found objects. Technical demonstrations will include woodworking, welding and mold making. Studies will also engage light, sound, space and time. Art history and contemporary theory will inform our discussion. The course is designed to develop fundamental art making skills as well as the ability to interpret visual art. Class size: 14",

Particular emphasis will be placed on direct and improvisational ways of working. The class will be structured around weekly and bi-weekly assignments that usually begin with an exercise that introduces the class to a medium, technique and set of ideas. Students will work with cardboard, string, found objects and other simple materials to make their three-dimensional artworks. They will then move on to work with mold making and casting, light carpentry and welding. While the department will supply most of the materials for this class, students will be expected to collect some on their own. These materials may come from sources such as the 99-cent store, the fabric store, the free store and the recycling center. Group critiques of projects will be supplemented by demonstrations in materials and techniques, presentations of related modern and contemporary artwork and discussions of readings. Class size: 14",

Through the projects, a diversity of options will be explored in terms of media uses, image versus abstraction, a single drawing versus a series, large versus small, color versus black and white etc. Imagination and experimentation will be encouraged as well as a deepening understanding of how these different drawing options affect the meaning of what is being looked at. Class discussions and critiques will focus on the transformation of the creative impulse into concept and concept into visual realization. The goal is to gain an ability for independent and self-directed work by the end of the semester. Students should have taken Drawing and/or Painting 2, but will be admitted on a case-by-case basis.

The Seminar focuses on the development of the student as a thinking and working artist. This is accomplished through variety of approaches. Presentations are made by visiting artists and Studio Arts faculty who discuss their life and work. Students develop a series of projects designed to aid them in recognizing, conceptualizing, and articulating their particular artistic interests. Presentations by alumni from the Bard studio arts program provide a glimpse into the future; and, workshops on the photographing of art and website development help the student prepare for life after Bard. Exhibitions in the fall semester will draw students out of their studios well before the presentation of their senior show. Required studio visits from faculty members other than the project advisor insure fresh and varied responses to the ongoing senior project. The Senior Project Exhibition is the culmination of the Senior year and is evaluated before a faculty review board and a Senior Seminar critique. *Any student registered in Studio Art Senior Project or any student of another discipline who has been granted studio space in either the Fisher Studio\nArt Center or the U.B.S. Exhibition Center in Red Hook will be required to register and participate in all aspects of Senior Seminar. Class size: 20",

This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance.

We will ask why some new versions have become iconic in their own right, and what makes for a particularly successful adaptation, addressing the constraints, norms, and cultural connotations of each medium. Using A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream as our primary source text we will unpack Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic strategies (such as juxtaposition, comic tropes and conventions, extremity, fantasy) and examine existing adaptations (films, poetry, graphic novels, plays, musicals, television.) We will also create our own contemporary responses to the play in a variety of genres, which we will both write and perform. Admission by application. Applications are welcome from upper-level students with substantial backgrounds in writing, theater, dance, music, or studio arts. To apply, send a cover letter, resum\u00e9, and 5-10 page creative writing sample, to: theaterapp@bard.edu by midnight on May 1, 2015.

To what extent does such a work represent the general culture out of which it emerged, and to what extent does it reflect an individual consciousness? How does our assumption of who the author is affect how our reading of the text? We will be keeping these questions in mind as we examine the shift in medieval and Renaissance literature from epic to lyric and romance; from orally-based literature to written texts; and from anonymous poets to professional writers. Texts to be read will include The Song of Roland, troubadour lyrics, Arthurian romances, The Romance of the Rose, Dante's Inferno, Petrarch\u2019s sonnets, Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, Christine de Pizan's Book of the City of Ladies, and Francois Villon's Testament.

Our discussions will begin by examining the dialogue between poetry and the other arts of the Baroque, especially the music of Bach and the sculpture of Bernini. Then our focus will be on how principal literary debates (e.g., the quarrel of the ancients and moderns, the aesthetic attitudes of the New Science, the Encyclopedia project, and the emergence of modern feminism) shaped some of the profound historical and cultural changes of the age. As part of our sustained reflection on the role and reach and poetry, we will also examine the critique of Enlightenment rationality and rhetoric in the Age of Sensibility and Storm and Stress movements. A final goal will be to consider how the idea of \"literature\" itself underwent changes in the 17th and 18th centuries that reflected the complex attitudes toward modernity in this period of scientific, cultural, and political revolution. Authors will include Descartes, Vico, Voltaire, Mme de Graffigny, Rousseau, Goethe, and Wollstonecraft; as well as their recent critics Adorno, Culler, Eagleton, Habermas, and Said. Class size: 22",

We will read widely within the early literature of England, from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf to Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, but we will also read closely, attending to language, choices of form and content, historical context, and the continuum of conventions and expectations that our texts enact and sometimes pointedly break in order to fashion the beginnings of a self-consciously English literature. Other texts will include Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales,The Book of Margery Kempe, medieval religious and morality plays, More\u2019s Utopia, Elizabethan sonnets, and Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus.

In this course, relying on Maria Todorova\u2019s Imagining the Balkans and Vesna Goldsworthy\u2019s Inventing Ruritania to frame questions and provoke discussion, we will read fiction, nonfiction and poetry from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia that explores past and present as represented by Balkan writers themselves. During the first half of the course we will concentrate on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the struggle for liberation from the five-hundred year \"Turkish Yoke\" led in turn to the lasting enmities of the Balkan Wars and varied Balkan participation in World War II. For the second half we will examine writing that has come out of the fall of communist regimes since 1989, and the wars provoked by the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Authors include but are not limited to Ismail Kadare (Albania), Ivan Vazov, Vladislav Todorov (Bulgaria), Miroslav Krle\u017ea, Slavenka Draculic, Dubravka Ugre\u015di\u0107 (Croatia), C.P.

Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St. Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.

We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch ; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday; Wolves of the Crescent Moon by Yousef Al-Mohaimeed, and Bound to Violence by Yambo\nOuleguem. We will also watch a number of films based on the novels (including Chronicles, Smilla's Sense, Balzac, Snow Falling), and The First Grader (2001, on the right to education in Kenya).

We will also explore the politics of literary translation and the dissemination of \"world\" literatures: How do certain texts make it to Western readership? How does Orientalism and neo-Orientalism figure in the post-9/11 world? Also considered is the figure of Shahrazad and the \"life\" of the legendary figure from the Arabian Nights as she is portrayed in both Western and Arab literature, art, and film. Literary theory, gender studies, feminist theory, and literary historiography will inform the literature. Frequent written assignments and active class participation are required. Class size:\n22",

When they are pushed out of or flee their native countries, they can be legally described as \"refugees,\" but there are many others who leave their homes fearing death or detention and are turned into \"exiles.\" Today nearly 40 million people are counted as refugees or 'internally displaced people.'Hannah Arendt described stateless people as \"the most symptomatic group in contemporary politics,\" and this seminar will explore some of the factors underlying displacement and some of the responses -- especially literary -- to it. We will ask about the experience of eviction and movement, and about the meaning of refuge. Although we will be attentive to political and social dimensions of the refugee experience, our focus will be on imaginative reflections on and accounts of displacement, flight, and (re)settlement. Among the texts considered will be: Aleksander Hemon's Nowhere Man, Tahar Ben Jelloun's The Blinding Absence of Light, Leila Abouleila's Minaret, Goethe's Conversation with Germand Refugees, Jean Marteilhe's Galley Slave, Robin Gwynn's Hugenot Heritage. We will also watch several films, including \"Casablanca,\" \"Christ Stopped at Eboli,\" Elia Kazan's \"America, America,\" and Senegalese director Mouse Toure's \"The Pirouge.\" Class size: 18",

Clandestine murders, otherworldly revenants, disguise, madness, and a final scene of brutal bloodshed: these characterize the revenge tragedy, a form of drama extremely popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. Revenge tragedies function not only as a form of social critique - they also speak to the anxieties and wonder that accompanied new modes of understanding the physical world, human emotion, and individual accountability. We\u2019ll begin by investigating the early modern revenge tragedy\u2019s antecedent, Senecan tragedy, before moving to consider the emergence of the revenge tragedy in its own context during the late-16th and early-17th centuries. Titles will include: The Spanish Tragedy, The Revenger's Tragedy, Titus Andronicus, 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, The Duchess of Malfi, and The Changeling. Finally, we shall examine modern instantiations of the genre - such as A History of Violence, Park Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy, Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover - to consider how these pieces pay homage to and deviate from their forebears.

We will begin by identifying impulses in Emerson\u2019s writing (individualism, self-creation, pragmatism, languages of movement and becoming, aesthetic religion) and examine their development in thinkers like William James, John Dewey, F.S. Fitzgerald, Richard Rorty, and Stanley Cavell, as well as critiques from George Santayana, Joan Scott, and others. Jonathan Edwards will be the point of departure for the Protestant tradition, and we will trace its concerns (original sin and the tragic sense, the transcendence of justice, the imperatives of ethical reform) through the writings of Jane Addams, William Faulkner, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Martin Luther King, Jr. We will consider the criticism of this tradition in writers like H.L. Menken, and examine the transference of moral and emotional authority from American Protestantism to the domains of psychoanalysis and social science (Philip Rieff, Norman O. Brown, Margaret Mead). Finally, beginning with Walt Whitman, we will investigate conceptualizations and critiques of American pluralism and egalitarianism as they develop through the writings of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Randolph Bourne, W.E.B.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies, Experimental Humanities, Human Rights, Middle Eastern Studies This course takes its provocative title from the American media\u2019s favorite post 9/11 question with regards to the Middle East and the larger Muslim world. However, the intention here is not to try and answer this question but rather to interrogate and problematize it, by examining how this region has been historically produced as an \"other\" by the West and why such ideas continue to have currency in the contemporary moment. Beginning with 19th century orientalism and European colonialism, this course will trace the development of representations of the \"orient\" in a range of literary, artistic and cinematic production. Whether it is the licentious sheikh with his exotic harem, the suicide bomber promised seven virgins in the afterlife, or the oil-rich businessman, certain images have dominated the Western imagining of the \"Orient.\" Through an interdisciplinary approach, we will unpack some of these representations, situating them with a larger historical and political context. We will consider how the region has been gendered and sexualized from Flaubert to \"Sex and the City.\" We will also consider the ways in which such representations have been internalized and reproduced in the region. Additional themes covered in the course will include travelers and travel writing, biblical landscapes, imagined oil fields, and fatwas and fanatics. Readings will include Edward Said, Edward   Lane, Alan Nidel, Ella Shohat and Jack Shaheen. Class size: 15",

        "description": "At what past moment did the future grow so dark? Formal literary dystopia has been with us prominently since at least 1726, with the arrival of Swift\u2019s Gulliver. But the tendency to critique the present by imagining a darkly extrapolated future surely extends back much further \u2013 and grew in prevalence and popularity until the twentieth became the veritable dystopic century. Today central components of dystopian satire -- global climate destruction, nuclear annihilation, terrorist states \u2013 have become commonplaces of our politics. In such a world has dystopia become prophetic, or redundant? In this seminar we will grapple with that question, as we explore the literature of dystopia present and past, plumbing increasingly murky visions of destruction to come. Authors whose work we will read include Margaret Atwood, J.G. Ballard, Anthony Burgess, William Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, P.D. James, Franz Kafka, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov, Philip Roth, Vladimir Sorokin, H.G. Welles, and Yevgeny Zamyatin. Open only to moderated Upper College students. Class size: 15",

We will also question the narrative and stylistic function of homosexuality, discuss the significance of the massive social disruption brought about by the Great War and investigate why the visual arts and music are seminal to the narration.

        "department": "lit3courses",
        "description": "This course is centered around American literary texts produced between (roughly) 1865 and 1914, by a variety of writers seeking to convey the \"realities\" of American life and culture in this turbulent period. A conventional understanding of Realism has, for many years, been defined by the works of James, Howells, Twain, Crane, Dreiser, Wharton, and Chopin---a handful of writers whose influential and significant contributions to the aesthetic movement of Realism are uncontested, but whose positionality (especially as white, privileged, and, for the most part, male) severely limited their ability to record, shape, or criticize the diverse whole of \"real\" American life. Alongside works by these writers, then, we will also examine texts by writers of color, of varying ethnicities, and by greater numbers of women, in order to access and better understand the different realities they were striving to document and influence. Texts by Zitkala-Sa, Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. DuBois, James Weldon Johnson, and Sui Sin Far---whose contributions are now, finally, garnering attention as responsive to and constitutive of a larger Realist aesthetic---flesh out our shared reading list, enriching and complicating our encounters with American languages, stories, and forms. In addition to the course readings, students will work closely with essays in contemporary criticism to analyze how current scholars wrangle with problems of defining Realism and its offshoots, among them Naturalism and Regionalism. A variety of writing assignments will afford us the opportunity to consider how small groups of texts converse about Realism\u2019s major themes and preoccupations.

        "description": "Over the past several decades the critical boundaries between literary novels and genre fiction have become\u2014as the result of ambitious work by various innovative, pioneering writers\u2014increasingly ambiguous. The earliest gothicists framed their tales within the metaphoric scapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic grottoes, chthonic settings populated by protagonists whose inverted psyches led them to test the edges of propriety and sanity. Masters such as Angela Carter, William Gaddis, and Cormac McCarthy, while embracing this same fundamentally dark artistic vision, have radically reinvented and contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative arcs to create a new phase in this historic tradition. This movement, identified as the New Gothic, appears to have risen in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, which for the purposes of this course is termed New Wave Fabulism, whose achievement is to have taken the genre of fantasy/horror in a similar literary direction. While not breaking allegiance with the fundamental spirit that animates its genre counterparts, writers such as John Crowley, Kelly Link, and Elizabeth Hand are creating a body of serious literary fiction that deserves critical examination. Among others we will read are Robert Coover, Brian Evenson, Karen Russell, and Peter Straub. One or two authors will join us in class to discuss their work with students and give a reading. ",

The central work of the course is the student\u2019s own writing, along with the articulation, private and shared, of response to it. Readings are undertaken in contemporary and traditional poets, according to the needs of the group, toward the development of familiarity with poetic form, poetic movement, and poetic energy.

Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, this workshop considers it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way, students encounter such aspects of poetic form as patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment. Writing for the course takes the form of creative responses to a wide variety of reading and weekly \"experiments.\" ",

The personal essay is an informal essay that begins in the details of everyday life and expands to a larger idea. Emphasis is placed on reading closely to discover the craft of the work: how scenes and characters are developed, how dialogue can be used, how the form can fracture from linear narrative to the collage. Students\u2019 works\u2014three long essays\u2014are critiqued in a workshop format. The course is for students with experience in writing workshops, fiction writers and poets who want to explore another genre, and writers who enjoy expressing ideas through the lens of personal experience.

In this manner an ongoing conversation begins to take place: one that can extend well beyond Bard. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the mechanics of literary community building, from submitting, interning, blogging, tweeting (one recent editor of The Paris Review Daily maintains a Twitter feed about all things Pym), forming literary chat rooms and real-life book clubs. We will consider strategies for sustainable engagement with the reading and writing students have cherished at Bard, extending into their twenties and far beyond. The professor will come for intense sessions (two days in a row) three times during the semester. The weeks in between, the class will meet and Skype with the professor. The professor will also require written responses to the reading biweekly. This is a yearlong course; those who register for Fall 2015 must commit to continue for Spring 2016. Class size: 14",

That\u2019s arguable. But it is true at least that a bat\u2019s experience\u2014or that of any other nonhuman consciousness\u2014is not inaccessible to humanimagination. In this course we will read and discuss a wide variety of texts, approaching the subject of nonhuman consciousness through literature, philosophy, and science.

The primary purpose is to guide seniors, both practically and philosophically, in the daunting task of creating a coherent and inspired creative work of high quality within a single academic year. Emphasis will be on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This will supplement but never supplant the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) will all contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

We will begin with the beginnings of recorded civilization in the Near East about 7000 BCE and will move fairly quickly through the Neolithic period, to the urban revolution of the third millennium (early Bronze Age). The focus then will sharpen to the Mediterranean basin: Greece (c.1600-320 BCE) and Rome (c. 600 BCE-430 CE). The main emphasis of the course will be on these latter two cultures and understanding how they came to be shaped in quite different and distinctive ways. We will also, however, focus on the chronological and causal sweep of ancient Mediterranean culture as a whole, from its first beginnings to the death of St. Augustine, with the Vandals storming the gates of Carthage. We will look at underlying features of geography and demography, archaeology (and how to read archaeological remains historically), developments in technology and trade, religion, politics, family organization, communities and governments, art and literacy -- and we will try to consider how all these different kinds of causally-linked factors come together in different ways, at different points in the chronological and geographical continuum of the ancient Mediterranean world.

Written while Rome was in the midst of a new foundation under Augustus, Livy\u2019s work contributed to a vigorous contemporary debate\u2014shared by fellow writers such as Virgil, Propertius, and Ovid\u2014about Roman origins. In addition to our careful reading of the Latin, emphasis will be placed on developing a range of critical approaches to Livy\u2019s text.

Although we will read several texts commonly included in the canon of the Querelle, this course is not meant to be a survey of this specific historical conflict, but rather a broader exploration of the roles played by the past, the present and the future in the creation and reception of works of literature in the French tradition. We will focus on several authorial oppositions (Corneille/Racine, Voltaire/Rousseau, Balzac/Flaubert, Sartre/Blanchot), oppositions which each time restate the place of literature on the temporal spectrum.

As Victor Hugo\u2019s age of lyric romanticism came to an end, these poets took full measure of a modern subjectivity in crisis by making it a crisis of form, with increasing disenchantment, irony, self-reflexivity, and obscurity. Their challenge to figurative language ultimately brought poetry dangerously close to silence, madness or death. We will, through a succession of close readings, assess the range of this poetic revolution, one that constantly questioned the limits of literature and the very possibility of meaning. Taught in French. Primary texts in French, secondary sources in English. Readings include Les Fleurs du Mal and Le Spleen de Paris (Baudelaire), Illuminations and Une Saison en enfer (Rimbaud), Poesies (Mallarm\u00e9). Class size: 18",

In this course, we shall explore the interconnections between politics, art, and social life through manifold literary texts (e.g. D\u00f6blin, Nabokov, Baudelaire, Poe), major theoretical writings (e.g. Benjamin, de Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Young), as well as through films (e.g. Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, Triumph of Will, Run Lola Run), architecture (Hitler's and Speer's plans for \"Germania\"), memorials (Holocaust memorial, Jewish Museum), and other visual art works (e.g. by Kollwitz, Grosz, street art). Our scrutiny of the significant changes in Berlin over the past century will focus on two historical thresholds: Around 1930, when the totalitarian regimes in Europe emerged, and around 1989, when this \"age of the extremes\" seems to come to an end, and our contemporary period with its compelling developments begins. Berlin can thus be called, in adaptation of Walter Benjamin's expression about Paris' significance for the 19th century, the capital of the 20th century. - Taught in English. Class size: 18",

        "description": "\"One alone is always wrong; but with two involved, the truth begins,\" reads an aphorism by Friedrich Nietzsche. His criticism of the isolated genius thinker also proposes an alternative mode of thinking and writing: creative collaboration. The seminar will explore several instances of such creative collaborations, e.g. Hannah Arendt and Hilde Domin, Bertolt Brecht and Walter Benjamin, Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. These intellectual relationships are also documented in letter exchanges, so that our seminar will unfold the word \"correspondence\" in a literal and in a figurative way. ",

The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi). It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust (Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy).

Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St. Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.

In this course we will read several twentieth-century texts that address the many tensions that arise in the process of modernization in the region. We will pay close attention to considerations of centers and margins, inclusions and exclusions, feelings of alienation and, ultimately, a search for community. We will explore how the danger of state violence enters domestic spaces, the role of mass media in shaping local culture, and the effects of globalization on identity formation. Among the authors we will read are Carlos Fuentes from Mexico, Roberto Arlt from Argentina, Fernando Vallejo from Colombia, Mario Vargas Llosa from Per\u00fa, and Diamela Eltit from Chile.

Examples include inherited diseases such assickle-cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and cystic fibrosis; endocrine disorders such as acromegaly; nutritional disorderssuch as vitamin and mineral deficiencies; therapeutic drug addiction and toxicities; various poisonings such as plantintoxications and rattlesnake envenomation; cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascularaccidents; neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease; allergies; and autoimmune diseasessuch as myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes mellitus. Many of the readings are relatively nontechnical casehistories, but the biology underlying each condition is thoroughly developed. This course is of interest to those focusingon a career in the health professions, but is also designed to provide liberal arts students with some degree of medicalliteracy in these health issues.

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior.

During the semester, students will learn how to use open-access bioinformatics tools such as de novo assemblers and how to create their own customized database to analyze their unique metagenomic dataset. More specifically, students will learn how to assemble DNA sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencers and to identify antibiotic resistance genes among diverse microbial genomes. Students will also use statistics and phylogenetics to study the links between antibiotic resistance in environmental microbes and human pathogens.

The versatility of these methods is discussed, using novel ways to apply these reactions to generate elusive structures. Variations in reactivity are discussed to illustrate the differential reactivity of similar functional groups and how these differences may be used in selectivity. Fairly complicated syntheses are evaluated to appreciate new ideas and approaches to synthesis.

We will start with a survey of the most compelling lines of evidence for climate change, how they are obtained/derived and some of their limitations. We will then discuss in some depth idealized one-dimensional planetary radiative and thermal balance, first in the absence of an atmosphere, and then in the presence of a radiatively active one, with variable number of layers. In this context, it will become interesting to explore atmospheric opacity with respect to various radiative types, and what natural and anthropogenic effects affect this opacity. A related topic will be natural feedbacks, such as water vapor and could feedbacks. We will next place current (modern) observations of climate change in the broader context of past climates, emphasizing the last couple millennia,hundreds of millennia, and finally the ten million-year scale geological record. We will conclude the course with some discussion about the objective of successful policy mitigation efforts, and their implementation obstacles. While not technical per se, participation in this course does require the ability to solve a couple of linear algebraic equations (like solving x + 4 = 2y and 2x - 3y = 6 for x and y) and to perform some very basic manipulation of data and plot the results (using, e.g., Microsoft's Excel).

These are traced from the speculations within the Ancient World to current scientific thinking and methods guiding the study of psychology and other social science disciplines. Importantly, because a discipline is also about people who advance it, students are introduced to the lives and times and ideas of individuals who have made significant contributions to the field. Particular attention is given to such figures as James, Pavlov, Freud, Skinner and Asch, to mention just a few. Illumination will also come from a consideration of correspondence between and among pivotal individuals in the field. Critical analyses and integrations are juxtaposed with historical renderings. Upper college students likely will benefit from this course because they already possess the foundational knowledge necessary to draw comparisons and critically evaluate varying points of view. Lower college students likely will use the course to greet the intellectual domains they enter. Class size: 22",

The ubiquitous (and often intrusive) nature of these advertisements invokes the sentiments of Will Rogers who once said, \"advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don\u2019t have for something they don\u2019t need.\" However, at their core, advertisements are designed to persuade an audience to take an action. For example, a recent advertising campaign funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely credited with helping over 100,000 people quit smoking. To influence consumer behavior, an advertisement must attract attention, leave a lasting memory trace, change preferences, and ultimately impact decision-making. In other words, creating a successful advertisement requires an understanding of how the mind works. In this course, students will learn the psychological principles underlying advertising strategies and how these influence consumer behavior. Class size: 22",

From annoying tip-of-the-tongue moments to more embarrassing (or worse) memory lapses, forgetting is a regular\u2014and sometimes even advantageous\u2014occurrence. But we still have a lot learn about exactly how and why these episodes occur. In this seminar, we will consider leading psychological and neuroscientific theories of forgetting, as well as the empirical evidence for them. Do memories simply decay over time or is interference to blame? Can memories be repressed only later to be recovered? How do drugs, alcohol, and traumatic head injuries affect memory consolidation? By the end of the course, you will have acquired the scientific background necessary to address these questions in relation to forgetting in your own life, as well as notorious cases of memory failures in the public sphere.

Does a 3-year old understand that two people can have different perceptions of the same experience? When do children realize that thoughts and dreams can\u2019t be touched, the way a toy can?

Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

Several hearths or fireplaces were recently found that may contain the oldest pottery in the Northeast. Knowledge of this key millennium in this region is sparse. We will concentrate initially on the location of another activity area for the manufacture and use of stone tools. Their utilization can be identified in the lab by replicative experimentation and microscopic analysis of wear patterns. We will later focus on the known hearth area. The skills, technical and conceptual, that Bardians learn in the course equip them for participation in the field of Cultural Resource Management. The class will meet Wednesdays for discussion of background texts on the Lenape [\"People\" in their language], CRM, and archaeological sites at Bard and its region.

This course will explore medical knowledge and practice in a variety of healing systems including that of western biomedicine, focusing on the human body as the site where illness is experienced, and upon which social meanings and political actions are inscribed. We will be concerned with how political economic systems, and the inequalities they engender--poverty, violence, discrimination--affect human well-being. Readings and films will represent different ethnographic perspectives on embodied experiences of illness and bodily imagery and treatment within widely differing sociopolitical systems. Topics will include biomedical constructs and body imagery, non-biomedical illnesses and healing systems including those in contemporary American society, the shaping of epidemic diseases such as malaria, TB and AIDS, colonial and post-colonial constructions of diseased bodies, cosmetic medical interventions, and new medical technologies.

We draw on research from the United States, South Africa, Australia, Sudan, France, Togo, Cameroon, Syria, Germany, Indonesia, Egypt, England, Gaza, and Venezuela. We begin with foundational theories of the state (e.g. Marx, Weber, Arendt, Althusser, Foucault, Bourdieu). We then turn to ethnographic cases to investigate the unlikely relationships between phenomena such as corruption, borders, railroads, the standardization of time, nuclear power, bureaucracies, forest fires and science, on the one hand, and the effects, and meanings, of statehood and state-making in the modern world, on the other. How do institutions, practices and people come to appear like a state in the first place? What networks and what processes of representation allow us to call states \"green,\" \"militarized,\" \"neoliberal,\" \"socialist\" or \"police\" states? How do we know when a state has become \"post-colonial\"? In asking these questions we will assume that environmental conditions, scientific practices and military technologies that help uphold state apparatuses are sociotechnical objects (per Bruno Latour), and can sometimes be manipulated by, forces we usually think of as distinctly political, economic, cultural or social. We will conclude with an examination of a question inspired by the recent political mobilizations in Ferguson, M.O. In what ways does it make sense \u2014and in what ways does it not\u2014to call the U.S. a \"police state\"? Class size: 22",

As people around the world engage on a daily (and even hourly) basis with a variety of different media and technology, humanities scholars have turned their attention to ways new and old media shape people\u2019s perception of time, space, publicity, knowledge, social and personal identity. Just as culture is being reshaped by everyday media practices, media itself has reshaped our idea of culture and humanity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. Drawing on key media theorists, such as, Walter Benjamin, Fredrick Kittler, Marshall McLuhen, Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Henry Jenkins, and others, we will examine topics that include \"old media\" like money and writing/print culture, as well as the rise of electronic media like the motion picture, radio, and digital media - what Jenkins has called the \"convergence culture\" of today. As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. ",

This course will consider travel as a cultural practice and the link between travel writing and ethnography. We will first discuss several genres of travel writing (postcards, letters, journals, guide-books, ethnography) and discuss how these texts reflect as well as shape the experience of travel. We will then ask how personal, group and national identities have been constructed through the practice of travel by looking at travelers writings from the 19th century, noting their connections to ethnographic studies written at the same time. How is \u2018home\u2019 configured in relation to foreign places in these texts? Using Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s A Small World, we will also examine some of the ethical dilemmas that tourism in particular poses: what impact does the traveler have on the communities they visit? We will then discuss travel as a rite of passage that depends on a person\u2019s absence from their home environment and provides a space that ostensibly is transformative, as in ritual pilgrimages, the Victorian Grand Tour, anthropological fieldwork or the post-college backpacking trip. Finally, we will consider the writings from exile or diaspora communities that challenge the master narrative of European travel from the \u2018center\u2019 to the \u2018periphery\u2019. The course will be based on a broad range of sources, including fiction about travel, ethnography, travelogues, letters, as well as anthropological theories about ethnography and travel writing. ",

The course examines the debate over the \"problem of race\" in its early formulation shaped by scientific racism and eugenics, especially the fear of degeneration. It then turns to the Brazilian policy of the 19th and early 20th centuries of branquemento (whitening) which was the basis of large-scale migration to Brazil from all major regions of Europe. These \"ethnic\" populations settled mainly in southern and south central Brazil leading to significant regional differences in identity politics and racial attitudes. The interplay of \"racial\" vs. \"ethnic\" identities is crucial to understanding the allocation of resources and status in Brazilian society. Inequality in contemporary Brazil is explored in terms of the dynamics of racial ideologies, the distribution of national resources and the performance of identity as shaped by \"racial\" and \"ethnic\" strategies, and recent government policies. The groups to be discussed are: indigenous/native Brazilians, the Luso-Brazilians, Japanese Brazilians, Euro-ethic Brazilians, and Brazilians of Arab and Jewish descent. Class size: 20",

        "description": "In the fall of 2008 financial systems worldwide became engulfed in a financial crisis of extraordinary proportions. Despite the intervention of global authorities, trillions of dollars in financial wealth disappeared, almost overnight. In the half a decade since, most developed countries have experienced lackluster economic growth, which have also impacted social conditions. All this has happened before and, most certainly, will happen again. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to some of the causes and effects of historical episodes of financial crisis. We will find that while certain similarities do exist, no two financial crises are exactly the same; that is, generating from the same causes, or creating the same economic effects, or being resolved in the same manner. Reviewing approximately four centuries of financial crisis through the examination of historical sources written by individuals living through the crises themselves, as well as subsequent scholarly and popular studies, we will develop a historically-based understanding of the impact of financial crisis upon social and economic conditions. In the course of our historical investigation into the causes and effects of financial crisis, we will attempt to answer such key questions as: Are financial crises themselves unavoidable? And, if not, what are the policy options available to authorities in the mitigation and resolution of financial crises. Class size: 22",

In this course, we attempt to achieve the following three objectives: (1) Understand all the concepts covered in Introduction to Microeconomics in terms of mathematics; (2) Study advanced topics such as choice under uncertainty and information asymmetry that have traditionally relied on mathematics for illustration of ideas; and (3) Learn how to use mathematics to conduct in-depth economic analysis. In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class. A firm grasp of the materials covered in this course is essential to reading economics journal articles and pursuing advanced studies in economics. Prerequisites: Calculus I and ECON 100.

The second part of the class is devoted to post-WWII Europe: reconstruction, the golden age, communism / socialism, the 80s turn around, Maastricht and the Euro, and the European crisis. The questions addressed include: What lessons does the Roman Empire teach us? What was the role of agriculture and urbanization in medieval Europe? Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges? The course is designed for inquiring minds who wish to understand how Europe came to be the major economic area it is now. Our approach is interdisciplinary (history, sociology, politics, geography, institutions\u2026); however we will insist on their economic aspect. Class size: 22",

Many young people today fear that Social Security will go bankrupt long before they will reach retirement age. Costs of medical care continue to grow faster than GDP. The Global Financial Crisis wiped out trillions of dollars of pension fund reserves. Will we be able to take care of growing numbers of seniors? If Social Security fails, will you have to support your own parents? Will you be able to accumulate enough retirement savings to see you through your \"golden years\"?

ECE views the economy as \"an open subsystem of a larger ecosystem that is finite, nongrowing, and materially closed (though open with respect to solar energy).\" As human population and production grow, say proponents, ECE is \"a necessary evolution of economic thought\" (Daly and Farley). The positive analyses of ECE are motivated by three normative social goals: (1) efficient allocation of scarce resources, including those\u2014such as ecosystem services\u2014that do not pass through markets; (2) justice in distribution; and (3) an ecologically sustainable scale of economic activity.

More and more income goes to capital-owners and profits, not workers and labor, and since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1%. There is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, and the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This course surveys landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and is research-based, through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. A substantial component of the course involves data procurement and analysis and in-class work on laptops. We focus on the United States and provide international comparisons.

We will begin with the beginnings of recorded civilization in the Near East about 7000 BCE and will move fairly quickly through the Neolithic period, to the urban revolution of the third millennium (early Bronze Age). The focus then will sharpen to the Mediterranean basin: Greece (c.1600-320 BCE) and Rome (c. 600 BCE-430 CE). The main emphasis of the course will be on these latter two cultures and understanding how they came to be shaped in quite different and distinctive ways. We will also, however, focus on the chronological and causal sweep of ancient Mediterranean culture as a whole, from its first beginnings to the death of St. Augustine, with the Vandals storming the gates of Carthage. We will look at underlying features of geography and demography, archaeology (and how to read archaeological remains historically), developments in technology and trade, religion, politics, family organization, communities and governments, art and literacy -- and we will try to consider how all these different kinds of causally-linked factors come together in different ways, at different points in the chronological and geographical continuum of the ancient Mediterranean world.

Yet the reality of American history belies this myth. The nation\u2019s history is transnational and yet we focus mostly on its Anglophone roots, ignoring that the \"U.S.\" was carved out of the contests of many empires and grew on internationally based forced labor regimes.

The course focuses on six moments that definitively challenged and shaped conceptions of \"American identity\", \"citizen\", and \"the United   States\": the early colonial period, the Constitutional Convention, Cherokee Removal, the era of the internal slave trade and the \"Market Revolution\", the Mexican-American War, and Reconstruction.

In an era of increasing globalization individuals are more likely to emigrate to distant shores, although this is in fact a longstanding historical phenomenon. Homelands in turn have taken on multiple, complex meanings in the imaginations and lived experience of migrant populations, particularly in recent times as technological and transportation innovations facilitate the maintenance of links with native lands. In this course we will read recent theoretical works on Diaspora and then examine case studies of diasporic populations from ancient times to the present. We will inquire about the extent to which Diaspora is celebrated or lamented, how this attitude affects real and imagined ties to homelands. While our focus will be chiefly on diasporic peoples themselves, we will examine the perspective of native/homeland populations on such issues as well. Case studies will include the first and longest-lived diasporic minority group, the Jewish people; black African-descended people since the trans-Atlantic slave trade; and Chinese and South Asian migrant populations.

This course is a journey across the motley religious landscape of early modern Europe in which the ideas and practices of heretics, infidels, and unbelievers nestled in the spaces where orthodox Catholicism held sway. Periodically, heads of state or household sought to bring order to it; and people \u2013royal subjects, wives, children, servants-- resisted. The 16th and 17th centuries were a time in which religious revolution and new ways of ordering spiritual life exploded in a fashion that no one could have anticipated. In the period we now term \"the Reformations\" Europe would reinvent itself at home and discover itself in the New  World. Also, the power of women as a source of threat and of sectarian strength emerges as a primary site for reformation processes. From the expulsion of Iberian Jews and Muslims to European contact with \"cannabalism,\" from Luther in Germany to Carmelites nuns in Canada, from witchcraft to the cult of Mary, from incantation to exorcism, students will trace the personal stories of real people through Inquisition records, diaries and conversion tales, early pamphlets, and accounts of uprisings. We will look at how radical religious ideologies sustained themselves in the face of official repression and, more challenging still, official approval. Open to first year students. Class size: 22",

In turn, the image and its archiving were critical facets of the continent\u2019s histories of liberation and post-independence. This survey introduces students to the historical development of photography in Africa and the historical use of photographs in the late-nineteenth century to recent times. Divided into five parts, the course begins with different theoretical views on the relationship between photography and history. After a consideration of the photography of the royal courts in North Africa and Christian missionaries in West Africa, the class will shift to the role of photography in the making of independent African nations and their liberation struggles during and after World War II. The course concludes by considering the commodization of African photography at international biennales and its functions for single-party regimes that continue to rule across Sub-Saharan Africa. Key themes include photography\u2019s role in shaping historical knowledge and the representation of Africa and its peoples, the appropriation of image making into African creative practices and daily life, the politics of exhibition and archiving, and the ethics of seeing war and social justice. Students will design a historical photography exhibition, and, over the course of the semester, they will also have the opportunity to interact with leading photography curators, photojournalists and art photographers who have spent time in Africa.

In exploring these themes, we will discuss examples of non-violent revolutions, militant revolts, labor strikes and coups d\u2019etat.

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies, American Studies, French Studies, Human Rights, LAIS Forced labor, whether indentured or enslaved, underpinned the early modern Atlantic world. Beginning in the early sixteenth century, millions of enslaved Africans and indigenous Americans came to or moved around the Americas. The wide variety of societies bordering the Atlantic that created these zones of interaction became places of contested and changing cultural practice. Peoples of African, Native American, and mixed descent not only struggled to survive in the early modern Atlantic but also to fundamentally shape these new locations as many fought to gain or preserve their freedom. Historians in the last thirty years have demonstrated how the territories bordering this ocean were an English Atlantic, a Dutch Atlantic, a French Atlantic, and an Iberian Atlantic. Yet the actors and agents who shaped or were shaped by Atlantic systems are often hidden in the record by virtue of being indigenous, enslaved, or indentured. Students of history, need to consider why it is important to restore a \"Kongolese,\" \"Cherokee,\" or \"m\u00e9tis\" Atlantic to the established set of European empires that are all-too-often seen to dominate the Atlantic world perspective. This course focuses on the African and indigenous Atlantics, and looks at a world of comparative slave societies in this early modern zone. It considers three important issues: the comparative development of slavery, the methods of resistance, and the processes of emancipation and national formations at the end of the eighteenth century. Studying the differing experiences of Africans around the Atlantic and how they helped to shape the diversity of the colonial experience will enable students to trace the initial development of \"African American\" culture, as well as \"Afro-Brazilian,\" \"Afro-Mexican,\" or \"Afro-Caribbean\" cultures. We will investigate what the implications are of how we write or remember the history of this region and trace the intersections that created race, gender, and class through slave societies. The course will end in the early years of the \"age of emancipations,\" with the most famous of all slave rebellions: the Haitian Revolution. This cataclysmic event gave rise to the world\u2019s first black republic and if the rhetoric of empire ushered in the birth of the \"Atlantic World,\" we live today with the mature, and lasting, effects and memories of these vital interactions.

Elites began to build large country houses surrounded by \"pleasure grounds\" that overlooked the river. The Bard campus comprises three of these estates as well a well as Native American sites and early farms. In this course students will explore the history of the nearby Hudson\nValley in order to produce a collaborative public history exhibit. Who were the early farmers and tenants? What is the history of Tivoli, Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Barrytown? Who built the estates? What inspired them? Who worked them?

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: German Studies In this research course, we will address the coercive and violent powers of the modern state as they were refined through technologies and techniques in National Socialist Germany, and then alternately condemned and utilized in the two German nations of the (East) German Democratic Republic (DDR) and the (West) German Federal Republic (BRD). Topics will range from the development of new techniques of propaganda and military oversight to the manipulation of social technologies such as identification papers, the census, racial pseudo-science, and, most horrifically, the concentration camp system. At the end of the Nazi period, the DDR defined itself through its resistance to the Nazi party, and nearly the entirety of its ideology was grounded in anti-Fascism and cosmopolitanism. The means of organizing and controlling society were often directly carried over from the Nazi past. Similarly, the liberal capitalist ideology of the BRD defined itself in complete opposition to the Nazi past, but here as well there were surprising number holdovers from the Nazi era, ranging from the system of registering with the police to the retention of leading bureaucrats. By comparing the two movements, ideologically complete opposites yet organizationally often surprisingly similar, we can address some of the most disturbing issues of modern techniques of social control. Similarly, protests within each system against specific moments of state power \u2013 ranging from issues such as the use of the census and identity cards to methods of police surveillance and conscription \u2013 were frequently couched in terms of their links with the Nazi era. Please note that the core of this course will be spent writing and refining an independent historical research paper of approximately 35 pages in length. No previous knowledge of German history is required, although students without such knowledge will need to set aside time for some background reading. Class size: 15",

We will ask whether these strange characters have thoughts and feelings, and whether, if so, they are like us in what they think and feel. The point is not to consider bizarre cases just for the sake of it, but to see what light they can shed on the nature of the mind.

Likewise, in Sigmund Freud\u2019s Thoughts for the Times on War and Death, Freud suggests that there are certain events in human history - certain moments in time - that demand, indeed necessitate, our thinking. The question is: to what extent can we and/or should we understand the task of philosophy as a task of thinking for the times? What is the role of time - of one\u2019s historical situation - in thinking? Is the philosopher capable of responding to the exigency of the times? Or is this role better served by politicians, journalists, poets? How can the philosopher theorize \u2018universal\u2019 structures (being, truth, value) and simultaneously ground his/her thinking in the \u2018particularities\u2019 of a given time? will explore the work of thinkers throughout the history of philosophy who have addressed these important questions. include: Plato, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Benjamin, Arendt, Foucault, Zizek, Butler, West, Ronell.

In the political sphere this encompasses the social contract and consent of the governed. In the legal sphere it entails the use of state power to fulfill the terms of private agreements. In the ethical sphere it necessitates questions of obligation. Voluntary consent normally serves to authorize one\u2019s participation in mutual exchange. But is one\u2019s consent voluntary if induced by duress or contaminated by circumstances of economic or social inequality? Should unjust agreements be enforceable? What if a just agreement between two parties causes an injustice to a third? Should one be allowed to consent to self- harm? We will examine ethical criteria used to determine when public intervention into private consensual conduct may be justified, and when not. Readings will include selections from Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, Wertheimer, Nozick, Nussbaum, West, Pateman, codes of sexual conduct and a number of judicial decisions. Class size: 15",

This course will take up the question of what it would mean to become fully conscious of what we do to animals and what they do for us. More specific questions we will discuss include: Should animals have some of the legal rights of humans? Could \"test-tube meat\" provide a viable alternative to slaughtering animals?

In addition to reading a number of Freud\u2019s major works, we will consider philosophical objections and resistances to Freudian psychoanalysis as well as the philosophical legacy thereof.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa  Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). ",

The awareness of the importance of the region and potential for instability animates much of American foreign policy, with the recently released 2015 National Security Strategy focused on the area in part due to the \"security dynamics of the region\" which \"risk escalation and conflict\". What are these \"security dynamics\" that risk instability? This class will identify and address some of the primary security concerns animating the interest in the region and the ongoing calls for an American presence. We will cover the debates surrounding the \"rise of China\" and the implications that has for the US-China relationship, but we will also focus on intra-regional concerns such the proliferation and development of nuclear weapons and the potential remilitarization of Japan. As well, we will identify and explore the nature of some of the major regional maritime disputes (China-Japan, South China Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan, and multilateral security institutions. Finally, we will identify potential areas for security and cooperation within the region as well as with major players internationally. Class size: 22",

But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions. Interested students should email Prof. Baruah prior to registration (baruah@bard.edu) with a short statement of why they would like to take this class. Class size: 20",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities, Human Rights, Philosophy 2 credits Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations have inaugurated a national discussion about the right of privacy. Over 50% of Americans still support the National Security Administration and among Americans under 30, support for the NSA is over 60%. We share our private lives on social media sites and think little of leaving digital signatures as we shop, read, and drive. We willingly trade privacy for the promise of both increased security and convenience. Privacy is being lost and few seem to care. We are told \"if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.\" But who has nothing to hide? What is lost when the dark recesses of the heart are exposed to the light of public censure? Hannah Arendt saw the private realm as the essential refuge for human uniqueness. In daily life, she writes, we \"return back from the outside world and withdraw into the security of private life within four walls.\" These walls of the private \"enclose a secure place, without which no living thing can thrive.\" For Arendt, \"Everything that lives, not vegetative life alone, emerges from darkness and, however strong its natural tendency to thrust itself into the light, it nevertheless needs the security of darkness to grow at all.\" If privacy guards the dark recesses of the human heart, she worried that in a transparent society, we are forced to police private urges and actions by public standards, our belief in public morality appears hypocritical. Distrusting ourselves, we trust no one, which is the source of cynicism of political life. This 2-unit class will meet 6 times. At five meetings prior to the Arendt Center Conference on Oct. 15-16 we will read material on privacy by Hannah Arendt and by authors speaking at the Hannah Arendt Center Conference, including David Brin. Students are required to attend at least two panels or talks at the conference. All students will be required to hand in a final assignment responding to the conference. This may be in the form of a blog post, videos, digital map, or other forms. There will be one post-conference meeting to discuss the conference and students will be able to present their work at the Experimental Humanities Share Event at the end of the semester. ",

Beyond the headlines, however, there are developing trends, emerging actors and competing explanations that are often overlooked. This course examines the international politics in MENA using the theoretical tools of international relations. Major themes include the nature of the state system in the MENA and its creation; the causes of conflict within the region; the roles played by outside powers; and the causes and effects of transnational forces such as Arab nationalism, Islamic radicalism, criminal networks, media and global economic actors. The course will also explore the nature of sub-state and sectarian identities and the effects on regional politics (ie, Sunni vs Shi\u2019i Islam, Kurds, Amazigh. These themes are explored in the context of several case studies, including, but not limited to, the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, the wars in Iraq, the revolution in Libya, and the ongoing crisis in Syria. The course will offer students a better understanding of the international politics of the MENA and will help students appreciate the competing pressures on policymakers as the region changes in rapid and complex ways.  The course will also highlight ways in which international relations theory can be applied to real-world situations. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights, Philosophy In 1946, just after the defeat of the Nazis, a French schoolteacher Jean Beaufret wrote a letter to the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Beaufret asked two questions: First, How are we in the wake of the Holocaust to restore a sense to the word \"humanism\"? And second, How are we to understand the relationship between philosophy and ethics? Heidegger\u2019s response, later published as \"The Letter on Humanism,\" is one of the great efforts to think through the ethical and philosophical significance of the human being. For Heidegger, if we are to preserve the dignity of the human, we must forgo all \u2018isms\u2019 including humanism; we must resist the urge to define a human essence and instead seek the dignity of the human outside of all doctrines and systems. In doing so, Heidegger challenges the foundations of modern humanisms including human rights and liberal social democracy. In this class we will read Heidegger\u2019s \u2018Letter on Humanism\u2019 as well as works by Jean Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, and Peter Sloterdijk to ask how, if at all, we can assign dignity to humanity in the 21st century.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

And yet there are also themes and recurring patterns that tie the various periods and cultural settings of Buddhism together. In this course we will begin by examining some of the concepts at the heart of Buddhist psychology and philosophy; this is what Buddhism looks like on paper, so to speak. We will then turn to how Buddhists have practiced and to the institutions they have developed; this is how Buddhism actually looks on the ground. In the final section of the course we will focus more intently on some of the cultural settings in which Buddhism has developed (including the West), asking how Buddhism changed (or did not change) as it grew increasingly distant from its Indian origins. Students should come away from the course with an understanding of a handful of ideas and institutions central to Buddhist thought and practice, a rough idea as to the historical transmission of Buddhist (e.g., it went from India to China), and a sense of why this religion has enjoyed such a positive reputation in the West during the past century-and-a-half.

There are many instances in which Buddhist scriptures, commentaries, and teachings concerning this topic appear to contradict one another. Furthermore, Buddhism has incorporated views from the various cultures in which it has developed, and Buddhist attitudes toward gender in, say, medieval Tibet can be quite different from those found in modern Thailand, for example. In this course we explore these issues as they have appeared and been addressed in a number of Buddhist contexts. After spending our first week focusing on how gender and sexuality have been approached in the modern study of religion, we will turn to early Indian Buddhist attitudes towards gender, then to Buddhist nuns in varying cultural settings, and finally to a number of gender-related themes that have emerged during the course of Buddhism's development. At the end of the course students should be able to identify early Indian Buddhist attitudes towards gender and sexuality, and discuss how these attitudes persisted or changed as Buddhism entered other cultures; discuss the predicament of Buddhist nuns in the modern world; and understand the ways in which Western categories used to understand gender and sexuality are or are not applicable to Buddhism.",

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram at Yale University demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study, including the pronounced ethical considerations and the necessary generalizability to societal and historical contexts cannot be over-stated. As recently as five years ago a replication of the original study with only slight modifications was published (J. Burger, January 2009) and more recent studies reveals that \"obedience\" is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well. Also the ethical debate and ecological validity controversy have not lessened. But aside from the volume of investigations the current domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest; this because of historical events in the intervening years since1960. The seminar will convey that the continuing study of obedience phenomena is vital for the betterment of institutions - even in a democratic society - and that social scientists must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and learn the rudiments of how it can be minimized. This is an upper college seminar. It is designed for moderated social studies majors and even those from other divisions of the college, who will require permission of the instructor to enroll. Criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share the results of such reading and study. ",

The discipline views the individual in context of the larger society, and sheds light on how social structures constrain and enable our choices and actions. Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

Thus, the study of social and political dynamics in urban centers is crucial if we are to understand and address the pressing issues of the contemporary world. This course will allow students to explore these dynamics through an introduction to urban sociology: the study of social relations, processes, and changes in the urban context. We will begin by reading perspectives on the development of cities, followed by an examination of how the city and its socio-spatial configuration affect and are affected by social interactions, particularly across gender, race, and class lines. The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" Class size: 22",

The amount and type of punishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of punishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

We will also spend a substantial part of the course on the growing efforts by thoughtful Americans, mostly social scientists, to think about the directions that these patterns of group life may take in the coming few decades. Topics include: social mobility and economic wellbeing, interracial marriage, political power, discrimination, the impact of immigration, group identity and culture, the expected racial transformation to a non-white American majority.

Why does global inequality persist and why does a large share of the world\u2019s population continue to live in abject poverty, despite tremendous efforts made over the last half-century? Through the lens of specific topics, such as unequal impacts of environmental change, informal urban settlements and economies, and growing energy demands, this course examines such questions from two perspectives. First, we look at globalization and other structural forces that create and perpetuate global inequality. Second, we examine the goals and practices promoted by governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and communities. This course will push students to think critically about the meanings and consequences of development, as well as about the challenges and possibilities we face in addressing some of the major social problems of our time.

We will utilize a broad range of historical precedents and contemporary case studies\u2014including controversies over education, the environment, healthcare, police violence, and other topics guided by student interest\u2014to examine how these forms of engagement emerge, if and how they are transforming the meanings of democracy and citizenship, and how evolving understandings of race, class, and gender influence democratic processes.

Our approach will be chronological, but the subjects addressed will reflect the wide range of concerns present in the paintings, prints, tapestries, drawings, and sculpture of major European artists working north of the Alps during this period. Subjects touched on will include patronage, iconoclasm, distribution networks, religion, cross-currents with Italy, gender roles, and the invention and/or revival of local traditions.

The course explores how a deepening knowledge of antiquity (the invention of archaeology!), an ongoing development of art/architectural theory, and the continued study of the natural world crafted a visual vocabulary able to address the existential challenge posed by the Protestant north. Beginning with Leonardo da Vinci, the class analyzes the contributions of Michelangelo, Raphael, Correggio, Pontormo, Parmigianino, Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, and Palladio. In addition to secondary scholarship, readings incorporate primary sources by Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, Palladio, and Vasari. Requirements include a mid-term, a final, a critical essay, and a research paper on a work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Open to all students; fills both the Art History 15th century to 18th century requirement and the European Art requirement. Class size: 22. Completion of this class qualifies students for consideration for Roma in Situ, taught in Rome during January of odd-numbered years and completed at Bard in the Spring semester.

Travel and exploratory photographs of landscapes, people, and architecture were made by European and American photographers throughout the world. They reflect the photographers\u2019 preconceptions and expectations as well as the inherent properties of their subject matter. Such Photographs were produced as government surveys, historical records, souvenirs for travelers, scientific documents, and picturesque views. Imperialist expansion of European powers, the romantic poets\u2019 reverence for nature, and the projection of the photographers\u2019 (and their audiences\u2019) fantasies upon alien realms and peoples are among the forces that helped shape the travel photography of this period.

The term itself acquired a life of its own, making it into journals and newspapers. What appears to be a very recent phenomenon, however, constitutes only a chapter in a longer history of world organization. The course will utilize architecture both as an anchor and lens to study the history of world organization. Slave ships, plantation houses, embassies, assembly halls, banks, detention camps, corporate headquarters, seed bank vaults, as well as atlases, encyclopedias, and communication technologies, will provide us with focal points in an effort to historicize the emergence of a \"global space\" and decipher its architectural constructions. Readings will include historians and scholars such as Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Woodrow Wilson, Hannah Arendt, Cornelios Castoriadis, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Ulrich Beck, Saskia Sassen, Mark Mazower; as well as architectural projects and texts by Paul Otlet, Le Corbusier, Etienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, Buckminster Fuller, among others.

Beginning with the writings of Diderot and Baudelaire, we will examine the emergence of art criticism as a response to the public forum of the Salon and, subsequently, its relationship to other sites of presentation. We will also consider the position of art criticism in relation to film and cultural criticism, as well as models of the poet-critic and the artist-critic. Towards the end of the course we will look at the historical moment in which criticism became increasingly embroiled with theory. As the status of the public has changed in recent years we will ask how the role of criticism has transformed as well. Throughout the course we will ask the question, What can art criticism do? Assignments: Students will be required to submit a weekly response paper. Students will also write two reviews: one of an exhibition at the Center for Curatorial Studies, and one of an exhibition in New York. A final research paper (8-10 pages) will be due at the end of the semester.Class size: 18",

In Rome, the first week focuses on the ancient city, studying the evolving role of public monuments as the republic transformed into an empire. The second week explores post-antique (up to the present day) reconfiguration of antiquities in order to construct political and theological meaning. The portion of the class in Rome is rigorous, consisting of over seventy hours of lectures at archaeological sites, in museums, and in churches. During the spring semester, the class analyzes the art seen in Rome and discusses the secondary scholarship. Requirements include two presentations (one on texts, one on art), two exams, and a research paper term paper. The prerequisite for the class is successful completion of eitherRoman Art and Architecture (ARTH 210), Roman Urbanism (ARTH 227), or 16th-century Italian Renaissance Art,Architecture, and Urbanism (ArtH 236). The class is limited to sixteen students; priority is based on academic relevance and intellectual maturity. The cost of the Rome component is circa $1700 to include transportation in Rome, lodging, breakfast, museum admissions, and all but two dinners. Airfare is not included, and financial aid does not assist with this fee. Credit will only be awarded upon successful completion of both components of the class. Permission of the professor required.

Which were the architectures that thinkers were looking at? The goal will be to conduct a media archaeology of the spatial turn in the humanities and to bring in creative dialogue architecture, media, and theoretical speculation. Through the study of spaces such as panoramas, theaters, laboratories, and media technologies such as the stereoscope, telephone, and radio, students will investigate debates on territoriality, biopolitics, and mapping.

In the past several decades it has also been become more stylized for performances on stage and in dance competitions in the Middle East and abroad. This class will offer the opportunity to learn some \"traditional\" versions of dabkeh, danced in a line or a circle, as well as more contemporary choreographies designed for the stage. We will draw especially on forms of dabkeh danced and performed in Palestine today. No prior experience in dance or in dabkeh necessary. Sneakers or flat, hard-soled boots are required.

Course participants develop ways of using video's most fundamental property: its ability to reproduce a stream of real-time synchronized images and sounds. How does video technology mediate between on-screen performer and audience? How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"? How can performance artists use video playback devices, displays, projectors, and interactive elements to shape and enhance live art? Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities. The second half of the course concentrates on the use of video as a central component within live art events, plus a continued discussion about the larger cultural and psychological impact of live video production.

        "department": "music",
        "description": "Karlheinz Stockhausen and Luigi Nono were two major leaders of the post-war European avant-garde. Great composers both, they came from very different backgrounds--Stockhausen, a German Catholic, Nono an Italian Communist, but both espoused serialism early on, before turning away from it's strict application to expand their horizons in far freer directions. In this respect, the work of John Cage was a major influence. Coming from California and strongly influenced by Asian thought and his own anarchic American ideas of chance and indeterminacy, Cage offered a radically opposing view to the strictures of totally organized serialism. By the end of their lives, Stockhausen had devoted himself to his massive mystical opera\" Licht \" and Nono to very soft and delicate works like his opera Prometeo. All three composers utilized both acoustic and electronic media in their works as well as theatrical and multimedia techniques, breaking new ground in their efforts. Their writings explore new means as well. The works of all three will be analyzed and studied in detail. There will be a midterm and final paper. Class size: 15",

        "description": "\"In the Beginning, there was Rhythm,\" states the opening of an influential nineteenth-century study on time, motion, and labor. Although catchy, the adage is utterly fallacious. As this course attempts to show, there was never agreement about the phenomenon of \"Rhythm\" in the whole of human history. Musical rhythm, like time, is more accurately considered a relativity -- notions of musical motion, pulse, and meter vary across locations, communities, and individuals. Indeed, musical time changes over the course of time itself. In a History of Rhythm, students will discover various definitions for \"The Beat,\" multiple meanings and practices that dictated \"good rhythm\" within various musical cultures. Weekly lectures focus on historical musical notation, pedagogical techniques, compositional trends, and performance practices. The class will also analyze musical manuscripts and first editions by Machaut, Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and others. An ability to read music is required. Through the student's successful completion of a final project, this course can fulfill either the music history or theory requirement. Class size: 14",

The students pursue assignments that focus their attention on issues such as value contrast, warm and cool contrast, creating tonality, understanding the expressive and structural possibilities of the materiality of paint, as well as how all of these elements factor in the composition of form and space. The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well.

Students will be challenged to push the content and format of their paintings, to experiment with materials and scale, and to practice speaking about their work and the work of their peers. Material requirements will be in response to the particular needs of each exploration, but students will be expected to acquire materials and surfaces to work on as needed.

Students would work in different sizes and on different kinds of paper so that they could experience the intimacy of making small pencil drawings on heavy watercolor paper and large scale drawings on paper that they can erase often and beat up.

Exhibitions in the fall semester will draw students out of their studios well before the presentation of their senior show. Required studio visits from faculty members other than the project advisor insure fresh and varied responses to the ongoing senior project.

Commedia is cut-throat comedy born of social critique. The archetypes have present-day counterparts, but by living fully in the characters -- their passions, appetites (sexual, financial, culinary), and idiocy -- we find a humanity that transcends its history. This is a demanding physical acting class. Students will be expected to bring a full-throttle physicality, a high level of play and a brave sense of presence/humanity. They will learn mask technique through structured improvisation in class. Presentations of applied principles will be prepared outside of class to be performed/critiqued on a weekly basis.

With their revolutionary politics, audience provocations, and enthusiastic embrace of the new, the Futurists inaugurated a century of avant-garde performance. This course will investigate that century, tracing the European and American theatrical avant-gardes from 1909 to 1995, includingmovements and artists such as Expressionism, Surrealism and Dada; John Cage, Allan Kaprow, and Happenings; utopian collectives of the 1960s; Peter Handke, Heiner M\u00fcller, the Wooster Group and Reza Abdoh. We will explore questions including: the implications of assuming the mantle of the \"avant-garde\"; the contested status of the dramatic text in avant-garde performance; the relationship between performance and emerging media forms; and avant-garde artists\u2019 efforts to create radical fusions of art and life. This course will require a research paper, reading responses, and a presentation. Class size: 15",

Each possesses a distinctly singular voice. Yet as a group they have much in common, including their experimental and radical approaches to writing drama. Each is formally experimental, self-consciously theatrical and playfully inventive. In her own way, each challenges contemporary ideas of feminism and prods audiences to think about how they intersect with such concepts as race, class and capitalism. Still, the work of each is highly individual. As we investigate their similarities and differences we will ask ourselves, what common revelations do they have the potential to illuminate? Among the plays and essays that we will investigate are Parks\u2019 The America Play and Elements of Style, Churchill\u2019s trailblazing play Cloud Nine and the later absurdist plays Blue Kettle/Blue Heart, and The Princess Plays by Jelinek. Assignments will include in-class presentations, a research paper or performance project accompanied by an essay, and a final project. Class size: 16",

This seminar will conduct close readings of critical readings grounded in feminism, post-colonialism, and queer studies, and then explore how those texts illuminate and complicate the work of artists such as Justin Bond, Split Britches, Taylor Mac, Nao Bustamante and Charles Ludlam.

After the violent, imaginative ebullience of the Revolutionary period, how did literature stay alive during the darkest period of mass repression, censorship and terror when millions of Soviet citizens were either imprisoned or shot? What formal/aesthetic choices did these writers make in negotiating the demands of official ideology and Party discipline, on the one hand, and authentic literary expression, on the other? What image of history and of man did these \"Engineers of human souls\" produce? These are some of the questions we will ask and seek to answer. All readings will be in English.

How is 'Irishness' to be located in a text? What is the function of the term 'Irish' when applied to a piece of writing? In what ways does the idea of 'nationality' (or 'ethnicity,' or 'community') connect the literary, juridical, and political realms? What does artistic discourse have to do with political ethics? What might a post-national literature involve? Students will read artistic work by (inter alia) Jonathan Swift, Maria Edgeworth, J.M. Synge, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Flann O'Brien, Samuel Beckett, and Bram Stoker, Elizabeth Bowen, Brian Friel. Theoretical work by (inter alia) Rudolf Rocker, John Rawls, Noam Chomsky, and Benedict Anderson will be touched on. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies, Human Rights In a 1996 poem titled \"How to Write the Great American Indian Novel,\" Sherman Alexie delivered a series of jabs at the stereotypical Native narrative: \"the hero should often weep alone,\" for instance, while \"A white child and an Indian child, gender / not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.\" The endgame of such a story is, for Alexie, appropriation and genocide: \"all the white people will be Indians and all the Indians will be ghosts.\" The stereotypes are familiar and Alexie\u2019s satire has bite. Yet of course the field of American Indian fiction is in fact remarkably diverse in its tropes and its narrative forms. We will explore that diversity in texts written in English from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Certain concerns will recur, including population displacement, ecological disaster, the politics of religion, and the relationship between orality and print. We will pay equal attention, though, to each writer\u2019s unique approach to the genre of the novel. In doing so we will consider relationships to tradition, both cultural and literary, that exceed the commonplaces Alexie skewers. Authors will include Black Elk, James Fenimore Cooper, Louise Erdrich, D\u2019Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, John Oskison, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Yellow Bird. Class size: 22",

In this course you will be encouraged to think about how notions of childhood and teenagerdom are constructed and reproduced in Anglophone literature for young people, and to interrogate the social and literary structures that guide these representations. Our goal will be to gain familiarity with the history of children\u2019s literature in English and some of its major genres, while constantly challenging our own conceptions of childhood and literariness. How can we, as adults and critics, read a book that has been classed as \"children\u2019s literature\"? How do we theorize texts that are written for children by adults? What makes a work of children\u2019s literature a classic? Can we say that children\u2019s literature \"colonizes\" the child? Given their importance to contemporary ideas of the child, we will give special attention to questions of gender and sexuality throughout the semester.

To gain a fuller appreciation of the variety, complexity, and dramatic fascination of Goethe's Faust, we will also consider Faust literature before and after Goethe and explore the integration of Faust in music, theater, and film (e.g., Marlowe\u2019s tragedy Doctor Faustus, Arrigo Boito's opera Mefistofele, Friedrich W.

It often seems as if his most brutally poignant depictions of individuals in hopeless situations arise when he is also his most politically barbed. This course explores how Shakespeare uses the framework of tragedy to investigate the contours of political life, focusing specifically on how familial, friendship, and sexual ties reflect and influence overarching governmental realities. How do we understand kingship after seeing it portrayed as an isolating burden? What do the tragic consequences of notions like honor and duty reveal to us about the interrelations between early modern masculinity and political organization? As we closely analyze several of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies, including Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Hamlet, Coriolanus, and King Lear, we will also examine writings from the period by figures such as Machiavelli, Bodin, James I, and Thomas Hobbes in order to develop a rich sense of how the problems of government troubling the early modern period were exposed and interrogated upon the stage.This course counts as pre-1800 offering.

In just over a hundred years, it has been transformed from a largely rural, agricultural nation to a global symbol of high-tech hyper futurism. In this course, we will explore the myriad ways in which this process and the urban space it has created has been written and represented. We will ask how artists attempt to express and make sense of the shifting field of sensation and information that constitutes city life in modern Japan. We will also examine questions of what is lost in the rural to urban transition and problems of nostalgia and alienation in the countryside and new suburbs. The course explores how the experiences and emotions germane to metropolitan life can be expressed, communicated, and understood through literature, film, photography, music, manga, maps, and more.

In Western history, many of the individuals who have been most admired for their bravery are those who have willingly accepted death for a higher purpose, whether that purpose be intellectual (Socrates), religious (Jewish, Christian, or Muslim martyrs), or political (Thomas Becket, Mahatma Gandhi, Bobby Sands). But what if the cause for which the martyr wishes to sacrifice herself is not a good cause? What if the martyr is driven, not only by a desire for justice, but by a desire for glory or even for death? What if the martyr is willing to sacrifice, not only his life, but the lives of other people around him? What is the relation between martyrdom and fanaticism? In an effort to answer these questions, we will be considering a series of historical moments that produced martyrs, including the persecution of the early Christians, the Battle of Karbala, the Crusades, the Protestant Reformation, the Jesuit missions in Asia and America, the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century, and September 11th.

With its allegories and polyphonic voices, its multiple narratives, its deliberate silences, literature obscures our access to pat answers about good and evil, vice and virtue. Reading a historical account of courage or cowardice is radically different from its being conveyed in a poem, a play, or a novel. This class will examine how writers have disguised and distorted a quality such as courage to convey the multi-faceted nature of human motives and motivation. Each of our examples of courage will be read in clashing ways. Is Antigone's heroism a mark of hubris? Shakespeare's Cordelia's refusal to lie\nstubborness? Don Quixote's idealism insanity? Melville's Bartleby's standing up to authority obstructionism? Are Camus' The Plague and Saramago's Blindness allegories of courage or narratives of the absurd?

        "description": "The understanding that language inhabits the human subject is essential to Sigmund Freud\u2019s conception of the unconscious. It is Freud who taught us to read slips of the tongue, bungled actions, memory lapses, dreams, and symptoms\u2014what he calls formations of the unconscious\u2014as speech in their own right. He explored how speech implicates us at a level far beyond what we typically consider communication, how it structures us as subjects. While Freud\u2019s influence spans art, literature, and the human sciences, his ideas continue to engender wide-ranging debates about the efficacy of the psychoanalytical cure and its scientific status. Even those critical of Freud\u2019s method, however, cannot deny that his concepts (such as the unconscious, repression, transference, or sexual and death drives) have become part of our everyday language, thus bearing witness to the extent in which they are ingrained in the way we perceive ourselves, society, and the world. This course will address fundamental concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis, a field that encompasses both a body of theoretical knowledge and a clinical practice grounded in listening and interpretation. Readings will include selections from Freud\u2019s seminal texts, as well as writings by Jacques Lacan and other authors, whose work provides insight into Freud\u2019s ideas and their intersection with literature, film, and poetry, such as St\u00e9phaneMallarm\u00e9, Marguerite Duras, and W.

We will follow the mutations of a career that produced both hugely popular adventure novels and commercially disastrous narrative experiments (including Moby-Dick; or, the Whale, to which we will devote extended attention mid-semester).

The books we read, the tastes we acquire, and the ambitions we hold make us into insiders or outcasts, depending on where we stand. Do social structures inevitably reproduce themselves or can we ever hope to start over? Using literary and philosophical texts, this class will explore the tenuous process of passing from one condition to another. Whether this integrative process involves race, country, sexuality, gender, or socio-economics, it explodes the notion of a stable and unchanging self and focuses on border zones of culture and being. We will explore the threatening and liberating resonances of hybrid states and deterritorialized sensibility. Double-consciousness (W.E.B. Du Bois), double temporality (Spinoza), and double diaspora are some terms that will help us study the pain and loss involved in the plasticity of self, in the broken and rebuilt habits at the heart of our desire to be accepted.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Medieval Studies Throughout its history, romance has been criticized for the effects it has upon its readers. Dante Alighieri\u2019s Francesca ends up in Hell for eternity because she has read the romance of Lancelot, Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote tilts after windmills because he has been reading romances, and Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Emma Bovary veers into adulterous affairs because she has indulged in similar reading matter. The alternate world presented by romance\u2014with its knights errant, beautiful princesses, fantastic animals, enchanted forests, and decentralized geography\u2014can seem more attractive than our own mundane world and, in doing so, can threaten to distract us from this world and our responsibilities within it. Over the semester, we will be reading the major works of romance literature and, in doing so, will be considering the uncertain moral status of this genre. What function does romance play in our imaginative life? What is \"escapism,\" and is it necessarily undesirable? Is the danger of romance ultimately the danger of literature or even of the imagination itself? Texts to be read include classical romances; medieval Arthurian romances; Renaissance romance epics; and modern novels that emerge out of the romance tradition. This course counts as pre-1800 offering and as a literature junior seminar. It is open to all upper-college students in all concentrations. Class size: 15",

We begin in the early nineteenth century, when popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time, especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions and scholarly perspectives under debate in the emerging field of Disability Studies. Possible readings include short fiction by Poe, Hawthorne, Steinbeck, O\u2019Connor, and Morrison; novels by Howe (The Hermaphrodite), Phelps (The Silent Partner), Davis (Life in the Iron Mills), and Haddon (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time); memoirs by Keller, Mairs, Fries, and Kuusisto; drama by Nussbaum (Mishuganismo); and poetry by Whitman and Barnes, and from the groundbreaking recent anthology, Beauty is a Verb.

How did it produce geniuses on the level of Dante, Botticelli, Machiavelli, Michelangelo, Galileo, and Rossini, to name a few? And how did Florentine culture nurture groundbreaking innovation in the history of art, literature, and music? This new interdisciplinary course will explore the extraordinary impact of Florence in the arts and sciences. We will read the great authors associated with the city\u2014from famous native sons Dante and Machiavelli to illustrious literary pilgrims Leopardi and Montale\u2014and study the incredible ferment in painting and sculpture that made the city a center for aesthetic innovation. Topics include Florence\u2019s role in the history of music, especially its role in the invention of opera; the emergence of Florence as birthplace of the Italian language; representation of the city on screen by Roberto Rossellini and other filmmakers; Florence\u2019s presence in Futurist and avant-garde aesthetics; and such epochal Florentine historical events as the civil war between Dante\u2019s Guelphs and rival Ghibellines, the French siege of the city in 1494, Florence\u2019s time as capital of the recently unified Italy in the 1860s, and the disastrous Flood of 1966 that threatened to destroy some of the city\u2019s most precious works and buildings.

This course explores what depictions of rule-breakers and outlaws on stage can tell us about the organization of political and cultural power in the period, and also how these plays can help us interrogate our own position with respect to codes governing behavior. By reading works by Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, and others alongside both modern works of social theory and fascinating primary documents such as etiquette guides and political manifestos, we will investigate the ideological foundations of good behavior. More importantly, we will consider what can be gained by breaking some rules! Our units will focus on specific categories such as the braggart, the tomboy, the outcast, and the rebel as we analyze misbehavior in order to reevaluate confining categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and race.This course counts as pre-1800 offering.

Thompson on the party conventions, V.S. Naipaul on Trinidad. Other questions dealt with in this course include the vexed one of literary license. Reportage by Ryszard Kapuscinski and Curzio Malaparte is fine literature, to be sure. Both claimed to be writing journalism. But they clearly made things up. Can a writer have it both ways: the license of fiction, and the claim to be presenting the truth?

We will begin the course reading intensively to identify what is nature writing and what makes it compelling (or not). What is the focus of the nature writer and what are the challenges of the genre? To this end we will read works by Emerson, Thoreau, and Muir, and then move forward to contemporary writers such as Annie Dillard, Gretel Ehrlich, and Edward Abbey. There will be weekly writings on the readings and an occasional quiz. In addition, students will keep a nature journal and produce one longer creative essay that results from both experience and research, and one longer creative paper. This means that students must be willing to venture into the outdoors\u2014woods, river or mountains. Prior workshop experience is not necessary. A curiosity about the natural world is essential.

How does one, when given 5000 words of real estate in TheNew York Review of Books, or the New Yorker, or Harper's, write an essay which will engage the new work of literary merit -- a collection of poetry or stories; a novel; a biography of a writer of any of these forms -- and offer an opinion of the work's merits that is as fair to the ambitions of the author in question as it is to the larger endeavor of literary enterprise? How, in short, do you say what you think while the clock ticks and a reputation awaits being made or unmade? And how do you do that in a literary culture where less and less space is given over to this essential humanistic endeavor: the public conversation about books? In this workshop, we will read examples of literary criticism from throughout its history including writing by Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Thomas De Quincy, Virginia Wolff, Edmund Wilson, Mary McCarthy, John Updike, Denis Donoghue, David Foster Wallace, John Jeremiah Sullivan, Rivka Galchen, and James Wood. Through this exposure to the varieties of argumentative experience, we will learn how such pieces are structured and how arguments -- aesthetic ones -- are mounted and defended, to the end of writing a final, 3500-word piece of long-form literary criticism of our own.

        "description": "Aristotle states in hisPoeticsthat the representation (mimesis) of death does not result in the disgust or depression that tends to follow uponactuallywitnessing a carcass or cadaver. Instead, he argues, the representation of death allows us tolearnabout the state that inevitably awaits us all. Aristotle touches here on the ultimate point of human experience (death), by limiting its intellectual contemplation to the realm of representation, of art. This very gesture traces the path to rebirth: what is dead lives again (albeit differently) in its representation. This seminar will explore how exactly literature deals with and challenges the task that Aristotle assigns it. From advice on how best to prepare for death to the argument against the death penalty; from ritual sacrifice to suicide; from the resurrection of the dead to the euthanasia of the living; this course will address many of the ways in which literature veritably defies death. Readings from (but not limited to) Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Montaigne, Racine, Rousseau, Hugo, Nerval, Baudelaire, Sartre, Camus, Bataille, Blanchot and Quignard. Taught in French.

What are the ultimate effects of mediations of the written word, translations to hegemonic languages, and the interventions of well-intentioned intellectuals? How best to use writing as a mechanism to trace a space for dignity and \"difference\"?

Although students will be asked to read extensively within the obra of each of these writers, class time will be mainly spent in close analysis of selected texts.

In this regard, we will attempt to answer these and other questions: What occasioned the shift, in Neruda and Vallejo, from a vanguardist, hermetic poetry to a more accessible and socially-oriented poetry? How are Eastern religious and philosophical orientations, particularly those of Buddhism, manifested in the work of Paz? In what ways does the poetry of Guill\u00e9n respond to racial and socio-political issues crucial to an understanding of Cuba's history? How can we apply contemporary discourses concerning gender and the representation of the body to the poetry of Pizarnik?

Yet, we experience reading as a continuous flow of information. Reading reflects a fundamental question for the study of sensation and perception: how does our brain construct a stable representation of the world when provided with ever changing sensory information? This course will begin to address this, and related questions, by studying the anatomy and physiology of sensory structures that receive stimulus information, with a particular emphasis on the visual and auditory systems. Next, we will move to the cognitive processes that turn this raw sensory information into our perception of the world. Finally, we will discuss how the same sensory information can often lead to very different perceptions across individuals and cultures.

How do public policies affect decisions to save for retirement, seek preventive medical care, or conserve environmental resources? John F. Kennedy captured a truth about human decision-making when he noted that \"[t]he essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed to the decider himself.\" In this course, we will heed Kennedy's reminder that conscious reflection and verbal report often lead to inaccurate descriptions of the causes of our judgments and decisions. Our focus will be on trying to ascertain the underlying causes of these mental processes by relying on contemporary research in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, political science that offer the systematic study of how people make decisions given limited time and vast uncertainty. Sources will include empirical articles as well as review papers, videos, and case studies.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights A year or so ago a photography/psychology student discovered, or at least conjectured although not yet proven, that photographically conveying a sad or negative scene to a viewer was somehow easier then doing so for a cheerful landscape. Why do we more easily recognize and register the bad and why is it more salient in our lives than the good? The so-called negative bias that \"bad is stronger than good\" has been found across a wide array of psychological literature in both human and animal life. This demonstrated from Asch (1946) within his work on impression formation and in more recent literature surveys [Baumeister (2001); Rozin and Royzman (2001)] This bias moreover is consistent over a myriad of topics such as: social relations; emotions; mood; learning and even information processing; physiological arousal; and memory. In this seminar we examine studies across the domain of psychology and other disciplines to show that the phenomena is sufficiently ubiquitous so as to reflect and perhaps even explain the events sensed and perceived in our life space. Observe how the bad dominates the daily report in the media. What does this phenomenon mean with respect to the presence or absence of optimism and associated behavior, or for the conduct of child rearing or the power of the variable of happiness and other positive life circumstances? Moreover, an effort to find non-confirming data produces a negative result. No matter the variable studied bad exists at the center of our focus while good is relegated to the periphery. This is an upper college seminar for students of many disciplines. Class size: 10",

Now imagine you decide to read a newspaper on that bus. The conversation, the cars, and the person next to you are now irrelevant sources of information and the newspaper is now the relevant source of information. Reading on the bus demonstrates a fundamental function of executive control: the biasing of information processing in the service of internally generated goals. This course will investigate the mechanisms that underlie executive control, with a particular focus on executive control in situations where individuals must switch rapidly switch attention among multiple tasks. Topics will include classic and current computational models, analysis of task-switching and set-switching paradigms, and recent neuroimaging results. Readings will consist primarily of empirical and theoretical articles.

Using animal models, human experimental data, and epidemiological studies, this course will provide an in-depth look at the pathogenesis, disease course, and psychological, biological, and social consequences of eating disorders. We will discuss anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and obesity at length; however, we will also touch on other psychological and medical disturbances in eating behavior such as binge eating, picky eating, and food allergies. Readings for this course will primarily be empirical research, theoretical papers, and review articles drawn from the scientific literature on eating disorders. Assignments will include original research article presentations, an experiment proposal paper, and a critical analysis of existing research. While we may touch on some aspects of treatment, the course will largely focus on causes and consequences of disordered eating.

Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project). We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, \u2018nature\u2019), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology\u2019s own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

We will examine historical sources of these inequalities in colonial structures and their expression in contemporary cultural practices, giving attention both to social groups that seek to impose and maintain inequalities, and those who challenge them. After critically evaluating Latin American gender stereotypes, we will consider how gender is practiced and gender identities formed in particular local and global contexts. We will investigate urban elites and middle classes, and a variety of subaltern populations ranging from market women, to male factory workers, to groups struggling for indigenous rights, to transgendered prostitutes. Ritual contexts to be explored will include beauty contests, Carnival, and soccer, and Catholic, Protestant evangelical and Afro-Brazilian religious practices.

In artistic circles there has been a turn towards work that is conceived as ethnographic in terms of deep engagement and immersion in a social world, while in anthropology there has been a turn towards representing sensory worlds in ethnographies that use media other than/in addition to traditional genres of ethnographic writing. In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology -- participant-observation, interviews, and immersion - to create ethnographies in several different media, including film, video, audio, and experimental writing. The course will introduce students to some of the basic assumptions and methods of ethnographic research while also viewing and listening to the work of filmmakers, audiographers, and anthropologists, including Jean Rouch, Raymond Birdwhistel, Trinh T.

In the 1980s and 90s, as Japanese economic power and cultural influence grew worldwide, the nation's status as a global force was established beyond question. In more recent years, however, specters of economic recession, disenchanted youth, aging population, and nuclear disaster have produced new conditions of precarity, reconfiguring experiences and meanings of contemporary life. By focusing on such key transitions over the past seven decades, this course will offer an introduction to changing social, economic, and political formations in Japan from an anthropological perspective. Readings will include ethnographic works on economic recovery in the post-war period, gender in office politics, schools and disciplinary tactics, cultures of cuteness, delayed marriage and divorce, homelessness, and care for the elderly. The final section of the course will explore transnational dimensions of Japan in a global context, including the aspirations of Japanese youth in the U.S., and the globalization of popular culture genres such as anime and manga.

And two, to learn something about concepts whose meanings are either taken for granted in this context and concepts often thought to be irrelevant to modern Palestine, which is dismissed as an exceptional place. Questions will include: What is resistance? What are the politics of martyrdom? When is violence normalized? Are human rights dead? What is the relationship between journalism and statehood?

In the wake of such intense turmoil, nations struggled to reinvent themselves at the moment of Independence, scripting new national mythologies and appeals for unity. This course explores these contests over nationhood in the post-apartheid era, focusing primarily on the experiences of Zimbabwe and South Africa. Some of the main themes we will address include the politics of commemoration and the symbolic capital of liberation war veterans, the charismatic authority of individuals such as Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe, sexual violence and the trial of Jacob Zuma, the role of sport in reimagining national identity, and the paradox of white African belonging. We will examine memories of ethnic genocide in Matabeleland documented by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, and track new anxieties in the media precipitated by the influx of immigrants into South Africa. In the final section of the course, we will turn to recent alliances between Africa and China, and possibilities for the emergence of an alternate global order. Class size: 22",

The class will explore a distinction commonly made between 'memory' and 'history', asking on what basis this distinction is made and how it maps on to our ideas about foreign places and people. The techniques and technologies of public memory we will examine may include ancient \"memory palaces,\" historical writing, oral narrative, ritual, myth, monuments, museums and archives. We will also explore how radio and photography are used to produce national and familial representations of the past. The focus in each section will be on how the particular medium of remembering shapes the content of what is remembered. We will address who has access to memory practices, stressing the link between the production of particular memories and their political uses. The class will give students a theoretical base to write a final research paper that situates a contemporary memory practice in its specific cultural and historical context: the recent proliferation of family genealogies, Holocaust testimonies and/or museums, the truth commissions, local histories are among a few possible examples.",

Before the late nineteenth century, Sudan was host to numerous non-states and near-states. Indigenous political organization prior to conquest ranged fromacephalous societies in south Sudan to sultanates in the centre and west and\u2014in the 1890s and 1890s\u2014 the short-lived Mahdist theocratic revolutionary state, the first in modern history. Alegacy of this is a great diversity of cultures, language-worlds and modes of life. The class will focus on encounters betweenSudanese social and cultural formationsandthe moral worlds of the Middle East and the West. Itwill look at the ways in which successive global belief systems and other incursions from outside the Sudans have been resisted and/or assimilated by Sudanese social forces. It will analyse the many levels of interaction between the local and the global, between fast and slow-track modes of life, between indigenous cultural worlds and incursions from the outside, through a number of case studies drawn from recent history including anti-slavery,female genital cutting, the Darfur campaign, the International Criminal Court and the question of human rights documentation and transitionaljusticein the renewed conflictfollowingthe independence of South Sudan.

The past century in particular has witnessed a radical reconceptualization in the nature of human-animal relations, emerging in tandem with the modern environmentalist movement. Everywhere we turn, animals have captured the popular imagination, with dinosaurs crowned as the cultural icon of the 1990s, Shamu representing the fulfillment of our romantic vision of cetaceans, and Winnie the Pooh constituting a social universe in which children are taught morality and kindness. Beneath the centrality of animals in our social, economic, and physical worlds, moreover, lies their deep implication within human cultural politics. Some of the questions we will consider throughout the semester include: how, and by whom, is the line between humans and animal drawn? What are the politics of taxonomy and classification? How do animal subjectivities contribute to the formation of human identities? Where are animals positioned on the moral landscapes of cultures? We will explore these shifting terrains through the angle of \u2018animal geography,\u2019 a field that focuses on how animals have been socially defined, labeled, and ordered in cultural worldviews.

        "department": "economics",
        "description": "In the fall of 2008 financial systems worldwide became engulfed in a financial crisis of extraordinary proportions. Despite the intervention of global authorities, trillions of dollars in financial wealth disappeared, almost overnight. In the half a decade since, most developed countries have experienced lackluster economic growth, which have also impacted social conditions. All this has happened before and, most certainly, will happen again. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to some of the causes and effects of historical episodes of financial crisis. We will find that while certain similarities do exist, no two financial crises are exactly the same; that is, generating from the same causes, or creating the same economic effects, or being resolved in the same manner. Reviewing approximately four centuries of financial crisis through the examination of historical sources written by individuals living through the crises themselves, as well as subsequent scholarly and popular studies, we will develop a historically-based understanding of the impact of financial crisis upon social and economic conditions. In the course of our historical investigation into the causes and effects of financial crisis, we will attempt to answer such key questions as: Are financial crises themselves unavoidable? And, if not, what are the policy options available to authorities in the mitigation and resolution of financial crises. Class size: 22",

We then focus our attention on investigating economic theories that explain short run business cycles, the periods of recessions and booms that occur on a regular basis. An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries.

Since Adam Smith, economists have used different assumptions, models and methodologies to study the role of markets, states, and institutions in the process of social provisioning. This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world.

Relying on innovative policy experiments, the second literature attempts to answer \"small\" questions on whether a specific policy intervention (e.g. micro loans) can help improve a specific development outcome (e.g. small business growth). Students are expected to write an original research paper that draws on both traditions to address a specific development problem or policy. Prerequisites: Econ 229 and Econ 201, 202 or 221. ",

Its research agenda reaches broadly into diverse aspects of economic and social theory. As a practical philosophy, geoclassical thought has roots in ancient Arabic and Hebrew traditions. As an analytical system, it emerged during the 17th through the 19th centuries in the political economy of John Locke, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Henry George. We review the classic and contemporary literature of geoclassical economics and explore its relationship to other schools of economic thought\u2014neoclassical, ecological, and institutional. We also examine applications to both contemporary and enduring social problems, including: the Great Recession of 2008; rising inequality; crushing private and public debt burdens; distortionary taxes and subsidies; ecological destruction, urban blight, and suburban sprawl; and territorial disputes.

This course will examine the history of the German-speaking lands from Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 through the development of the German state in 1871, the cataclysmic initiation by this state of the two twentieth-century World Wars, and the creation of the new political entity of the European Union. Attention will placed throughout on the dialog of Germany and Europe in relation to regional structural issues, particularly state form and Realpolitik, capitalism and communism, the 'second-industrial revolution' and institutional development, and state control or surveillance and systems of rights. Using an array of primary documents, we will examine Germany's pivotal place in the ideological divisions, political catastrophes, and -- more optimistically -- theoretical, political, and scientific innovations of modern Europe. As a guiding theme, we will use the paradox that even as Germany is chronologically perhaps the most 'modern' of European states, its definition - and with it the identity of its citizens - has been haunted since inception by its heterogeneous past. Topics of particular importance will include: the multiple 'unifications' of Germany (as a culture, a state, a racist 'greater' Germany, a reunified power within the European Union), the role of 'German' and 'European' identity in colonial expansion and Nazi propaganda, 'scientific' racism and the Holocaust, the development of the DDR and BRD, the consolidation of the European Union since 1951, and the student protests of 1968.

Although dating back in its modern form to only the sixteenth century, the concept of the experiment as an attempt to find underlying continuities in experience has numerous origins stretching back to earliest recorded history. In this course, we will look at several different epochs' definition of experiment, focusing on the classical, medieval, and finally renaissance era to the present. Throughout, we will understand the concept of experiment as closely connected with an era's broader cosmology and definition of experience, and as such will see the epistemological problem of the experiment in a framework that includes aesthetics, theology, ethics and politics. We will also assume that \"experiment\" has taken different forms in the different sciences, and even in fields such as art and law.

The non-white racial groups we speak oftodayare part of this history: blacks, Asians and native Americans. But so too are the many European immigrant groups who arrived in their tens of millions by the 1920s: Italians, Slavs, Jews; and so too are Mexicans, Chinese and others. The course has two goals.First, it traces the social history of these peoples across the years of mass immigration, Depression, two world wars and the Civil Rights era (1950s and 1960s). Second, it also traces the ways in which these peoples were in fact understood -- especially by intellectuals and in government classifications like the Census. For example, immigration authorities regularly classified the European peoples mentioned above as races, and many Americans thought some of these races much more suited for America than others. So too did most of the Congressmen who voted to end unrestricted immigration in the twenties. Or to cite another example, the 1930 U.S. Census enumerated 'Mexicans' as a distinct race. And finally, federal concern with discrimination against American \"minorities\" developed from the forties to the sixties changing who was included among the minorities. In taking up such topics, we will also confront how and how much 'whiteness' was changing. Class size: 22",

In addition to being an oceanic divide, the Indian Ocean is a historiographical tradition through which to think about Africa\u2019s historical past in ways not permitted by the Black Atlantic tradition. This course seeks to engage the Indian Ocean as both an object of study and a theoretical lens onto Africa\u2019s history. In turn, it will consider the ways that populations in Africa and Asia even before European colonization engaged with the Ocean in their daily lives as well as how such activities like fishing, sailing and farming reshaped geographies of colonization and resistance in East and Central Africa. Students will use architectural plans and traveler accounts to reconstruct the historical origins of slave and trading towns on the Swahili Coast. Participants will also consider how this early history set the backdrop against which not only nationalist movements fought for Southern Africa\u2019s independence but the Cold War played out in Africa. This colonial and nationalist context offers an analytical space to revisit more recent engagements with the Indian Ocean, particularly China\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s renewed interest with the region, the mineral wars of the Great Lakes, and the identity politics at play around displaced migrant communities. This course seeks to use the history of the Indian Ocean as it relates to Africa in order to prompt a rethinking of the geographical and theoretical axes along which we engage with African histories of colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies, American Studies, Experimental Humanities, French Studies, Human Rights, LAIS Thousands of men march in a line towards cannons and muskets at point blank range. Abenakis watch the snow accumulate around the walls of an English fort, then scale over the defenses silently in the night to attack. En route to find the \"Lost City of Gold,\" Spanish soldiers sack Acoma Pueblo and then flee. \"Coromantees\" and Irish servants challenge English slaveholders' dominion in Barbados and nearly succeed. Colonial America existed in a constant state of war. This course is a close study of formal and informal military conflicts from the 16th to the early 19th centuries, looking at well-known engagements such as the so-called \"French and Indian War\" and lesser known episodes, like the French and Abenaki raid on Deerfield in 1704. Students will learn how European and indigenous American rules of violence developed, shifted, and adapted in response to the Columbian Exchange, and how war came to shape contemporary American identity. In addition to primary sources, we will consider literary, cinematic, and live reenactment interpretations of colonial conflicts and consider what these tell us about the relationships of history and memory.

Rather than studying the history of the colonized non-West in relation to Europe, this course brings to the forefront the connections between different parts of the colonized world, most notably the Middle East and South Asia. It does so through studying economic and intellectual developments. The two centuries under consideration witnessed major reorientations of the trade networks that tied together the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean economies, as well as the making (and re-making) of economic enterprises of global significance such as the East India Company in the 1700s, the Suez Canal in the 1800s and the discovery of oil in the 1900s. Along the same trade routes, and in response to the radically changing economies of the colonized world, emerged a plethora of ideas (and ideologies) such as nationalism, Islamism, anti-capitalism and, in the twentieth century, Third-Worldism.

But what was the violence of the colonial Americas really like? Who participated, who suffered, who fought, and what did it all mean? What constituted \"exceptional\" or \"daily\" violence? This seminar investigates the violent interactions between Native Americans and Europeans, between competing European empires, between slaves and masters, and all the categories in between - that shaped life in the colonial Americas. Theories of violence will be considered in addition to the primary and secondary colonial sources in order to understand the role violence plays in social and cultural formations.

In the Caribbean, global empires established African slavery and the first sugar plantations in the \"New World.\" Sugar soon became a tropical commodity for local production and global consumption. The Spanish Empire, the first major empire in the Caribbean in the sixteenth century, reasserted its power there in the nineteenth century. The Spanish colonial legacies of sugar, slavery, and revolution influenced Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico through the twentieth century and continue to influence these countries today. This seminar explores global connections and hybridities involving sugar, slavery, and revolution in the Spanish Caribbean, from the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.

An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are?

Within this utterance one can hear the perpetual human quest for knowledge, understanding, and truth, for reason, ground, and cause, for warrant and explanation. To ask \"why\" of the world is to refuse to take the world as a given. Indeed, to ask \"why\" of the world is to begin to engage in the act of philosophical thinking\u2014to demand analysis, reflection, and thought. The history of philosophy can be read as orbiting around a series of important \"why\" questions: Why being and not non-being? Why good and not evil? Why suffering? Why death? Why know? Why question? Why write? Why philosophize? This course will attempt to explore these questions and the ways in which they have been articulated and answered throughout the history of Philosophy. Philosophers to be addressed include: Plato, Descartes, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Arendt, Camus, and Sartre. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Mind, Brain & Behavior The philosophy of mind addresses questions regarding the nature of the mind-brain relation, mental representation, and conscious awareness, to name a few. The dominant trend in contemporary philosophy of mind is to pursue these questions in close alliance with empirical sciences, such as psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The result is typically a mechanistic and reductive picture of the mind, one on which the mind is just one arena among many in which causal factors operate to produce effects. However, some philosophers question whether a mechanistic picture of the mind can adequately accommodate our first person perspective, that is, what it feels like from the inside to have a mind and navigate the world with it. In this course, we will address the question of whether mechanistic accounts of the mind can accommodate our first person perspective by focusing on three main topics: the qualitative or phenomenological dimension of experience; our knowledge of our own attitudes; and our engagement in mental action.

This course is not just for those who care about the life of the medieval mind: it is also for anyone who wants to know what happened to ancient philosophy, or who is curious about where modern philosophy came from. And don't believe the hype: medieval philosophers are not a bunch of ivory-tower scholastics arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. In fact, medieval philosophers engaged deeply with many of the most difficult and vital philosophical questions: Do we have free will? Where does evil come from? What are the limits of human reason? Can the universe be fully explained, or does it contain an element of the irrational and mysterious? This course will introduce students to the rich variety of approaches medieval philosophers developed in thinking about these and other fundamental philosophical problems. We will especially focus on the insights and challenges medieval philosophers uncovered in their attempts to combine the pagan traditions of ancient philosophy with the prophetic revelations of Christianity and Islam.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 20",

What makes some people dare to speak truth to power and resist injustice while others cooperate in oppression or evil? Political courage comes not from a superhuman morality but flows from internal strength. Only those who know themselves and love themselves can risk themselves, secure in the belief that what they do is right and just. Courageous actors are self-thinkers who have the courage to be who they are even when \u2018who they are\u2019 is dangerous for the status quo. But how are we to understand and nurture the genesis of spiritual and moral courage in the face of a world increasingly beset by impersonal and bureaucratic systems of evil? Where can we find the courage to be advocates for good in world where all the incentives lead us to turn quietly away? Readings combine theoretical accounts from Hannah Arendt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Plato, Stanley Milgram, and Paul Tillich with examples of political courage including Antigone, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Ralph Ellison, Mahatma Gandhi, Daniel Ellsberg, Edward Snowden, and suicide bombers. This course is part of the College Seminar \"The Practice of Courage.\" It is open to Sophomores and Juniors and is limited to 16 students. Students are required to attend three evening lectures on Mondays from 6-8. There will also be dinner discussions with guest speakers and students from other sections of the College Seminar.

Students will gain an understanding of the basic goals, constraints and structures of diplomacy: diplomatic corps, embassies, consulates, aid missions, attaches, envoys and the use of non-traditional diplomats. They will then examine the evolution of those components and contexts to include public diplomacy, cyber diplomacy, diplomacy in combat zones and the use of international development as a foreign policy tool. Using selected diplomatic crises as case studies, students will analyze the roles played by different government agencies, militaries, international & regional organizations, the media, public interest groups, private foundations, contractors, commercial interests, educational institutions, and law enforcement officials. Students will explore how nations communicate with each other in the 21st century (formally and informally) and will use in-class simulations and videoconferences with students across the Bard international network to explore the roles played by different actors in addressing immediate crises and longer-term diplomatic issues. This course will enhance students\u2019 understanding of international relations, foreign policy formulation and implementation, and diplomatic history. Class size: 18",

The first generation of scholarsviewed the process somewhat optimistically as the global extension ofmodernity. Neo-Marxist critics tried to locate Third Worldunderdevelopment in the history of colonialism and in the persistenceof structures of dependency of Third World countries. \"Post-development\" theorists took on the idea of development itself. Globalization and the emergence of a new international division oflabor, has reframed the debates. Developing countries like Argentina,Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa are nowmembers of the G-20 group of countries, which many see as a likelysuccessor to the G8 group of leading industrial economies. Afterreading representative authors of competing theoretical traditions, wewill move on to concrete cases. This segment will be shaped partly bystudent interest.

In this class, our goal is to take anarchism seriously and study it as a complex social and political tradition and practice that involves a robust critique of the liberal-democratic tradition and modern capitalism. Questions that we will raise and explore include: What is anarchism and how has it historically evolved? How many different kinds of anarchism are there? What are the foundational values and principles of anarchism(s)? What distinct anarchist movements existed globally and how did they differ from each other? How do anarchist movements define their relationship to violence? Can we talk about a \"come-back\" of anarchism today? We will cover a broad range of theorists including Bakunin, Kropotkin, Hakim Bey, Alexander Berkman, and Emma Goldman, and address particular historical practices of anarchism including the experience of the French Commune, anarchism during the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, American anarchism, and Anarchists Against the Wall.

This timeless question serves as an entry point for this comparative politics seminar on \"democratization,\" a field of study that examines what social and political factors grease the transition to democracy and facilitate its consolidation; why does the consolidation of democratic institutions and practices proceeds faster in some countries than in others; and how do new democracies settle the legacies of human rights abuses left behind by the old regime, and what are the consequences of whatever decisions are made about those abuses for the emerging democratic regime? These questions are examined in this seminar through an expansive analysis of the theoretical literature on democratization and a wealth of empirical materials drawn from a wide range of countries that have embarked upon a transition to democracy since World War II. The first half of the course examines the concepts and issues in the study of democratization, like the meaning of democracy and the factors aiding in the rise and consolidation of democratic governance--from culture, to the economy, to the behavior of the elite and ordinary citizens. The second explores the politics of democratization in five cases: Germany after the Nazi regime; Spain after the Franco dictatorship; Argentina after military rule; Russia after Communism, and Egypt after the Mubarak regime.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Theology (Working Theologies course) Recent advances in the critical study of theology have developed paradigms of how religious systems function. For the purpose of the comparative study of religion, religious systems are approached along the lines of ritual, meaning, and ethics. In this course, each of these terms is explained further. But we can say provisionally that \"ritual\" refers to the agreed activities that people in society learn in order to relate commonly to one another and to the central values they share. \"Meaning\" involves how those values are articulated into a coherent view of the purpose of life in society, and often beyond society. (Typically, meaning involves a conception of the divine, but there are religious systems that resist postulation of God.) Finally, ethics is the actionable face of a religious system, where a person\u2019s engagement with daily life articulates religion in immediate terms. By approaching the basics of Christianity as a religious system that evolves through history, both their context and their significance will make it plain what makes them indispensable. At the same time, a theoretical approach that assesses Christianity as scholars of religion might approach any system means the analysis benefits, not only practitioners, but all those who wish to understand how the world\u2019s largest religion has grown, evolved, and shaped the sensibilities of its adherents.

It enforces a strict separation between men and women in many social situations, and prohibits even casual physical contact between husband and wife during the wife\u2019s menstrual period. It defines some sexual acts between two men as an \"abomination\" for which capital punishment is prescribed. What are the origins of these practices, and the social, theological, and psychological attitudes that they reflect? This course will examine a broad sweep of issues relating to gender and sexuality in the earliest strata of Jewish historical development, that is, the biblical and rabbinic periods. Topics to be covered will include public and private gender roles; power dynamics between men and women; views of sexuality, marriage and its variants; homosexuality; etc. We will read both narrative and legal primary texts, as well as current scholarship on the development of these issues in the ancient world.

Why do we more easily recognize and register the bad and why is it more salient in our lives than the good? The so-called negative bias that \"bad is stronger than good\" has been found across a wide array of psychological literature in both human and animal life. This demonstrated from Asch (1946) within his work on impression formation and in more recent literature surveys [Baumeister (2001); Rozin and Royzman (2001)] This bias moreover is consistent over a myriad of topics such as: social relations; emotions; mood; learning and even information processing; physiological arousal; and memory. In this seminar we examine studies across the domain of psychology and other disciplines to show that the phenomena is sufficiently ubiquitous so as to reflect and perhaps even explain the events sensed and perceived in our life space. Observe how the bad dominates the daily report in the media. What does this phenomenon mean with respect to the presence or absence of optimism and associated behavior, or for the conduct of child rearing or the power of the variable of happiness and other positive life circumstances? Moreover, an effort to find non-confirming data produces a negative result. No matter the variable studied bad exists at the center of our focus while good is relegated to the periphery. This is an upper college seminar for students of many disciplines. Class size: 10",

The discipline views the individual in context of the larger society, and sheds light on how social structures constrain and enable our choices and actions. Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined categories of persons (e.g., women and men, Blacks and Whites, rich and poor, native- and foreign-born) are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., prestige, income, occupation). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. education, intelligence, parental wealth, gender, race). Class size: 18",

These are profoundly social issues as well. Beyond identifying the growing list of today\u2019s environmental difficulties, this course will challenge students to critically assess the relationship between society and the environment at local and global scales. We will do so by examining three topics that are central to environmental sociology. First, the course explores how people collectively understand and frame environmental issues. In other words, how do we know an environmental issue when we see one? Second, we will examine how the natural world and its changes shape social organization, the distribution of power, and decision-making. Third, we will analyze how social structures, political and economic institutions, and individual human actions produce and respond to environmental change. Students will learn about the unequal distribution of the benefits and burdens of environmental change, as well as the ways that people are responding to the many contemporary environmental challenges.

We then follow these conversations into the contemporary era, examining traditions such as functionalism, conflict theory, rational choice, symbolic interactionism, feminist theory, and critical theory, including thinkers such as G.H. Mead, Robert Merton, Pierre Bourdieu, JurgenHabermas, and Michel Foucault.

We will then examine institutional, social and cultural explanations for wealth creation, and explore the link between family background and privilege. Finally, we will assess the extent to which the wealthy and those less privileged differ in their work experiences, personality traits, social networks and consumption patterns.

It asks how sexual identities and social categories of sexuality come to be and how they are maintained or changed over time. It examines how historically specific social contexts shape the meaning of sexual experiences and how we use sexuality to define ourselves, produce social hierarchies, and mark moral boundaries. We will begin with an introduction to theories of sexuality and consider the essentialist / constructionist debate. Then we use a historical perspective to look at the social institutions that help to produce, construct, and control sexual practice and identities, paying special attention to the role of gender, race, and class inequality. This will provide a basis for looking at the development of modern sexual communities, identities, and politics, including controversies over commodified sexuality and feminist debates about prostitution and pornography. Throughout the course will consider the important role of gender in the social organization of sexuality. We will also address how these social processes shape notions of personal identity and the self. Class size: 22",

The course looks at recent and classic academic literature on: issue emergence; imperialism; discourse; and on what makes an NGO effective or ineffective. The students draw both on that literature and on their practical experience to discuss these issues. Additionally, the Core Seminar features a number of guest speakers to highlight the variety of ways one can become a practitioner of international affairs and discuss the real life implications of what we\u2019ve discussed in class; and hosts supplemental skill-building workshops to promote professional development. Students should expect to do 20-25 pages of formal academic writing, as well as: a multimedia presentation; written analysis of the competing stakeholders related to their internship organization; and a series of response papers throughout the course.Class size: 15",

On one level, this means that it is about something you do yourself all the time -- but we will be looking specifically at how analysis is produced for those who work in both the public and the private sectors and face critical political, investment, or even humanitarian decisions. Concentrating on three crucial components \u2013 collection, analysis and communications \u2013 the goal is understand processes behind the production of good analysis and the ways in which it can be conveyed to decision makers. At the same time as intensively studying some of the instances in which intelligence analysis has resulted in success -- and, because it tends to be more revealing, those where it has not -- we will be trying out some of the techniques involved in professional analysis, including writing, presentations, and team work, and looking at analysts working in the government, financial, and non-profit sectors. The intention is to offer an appreciation of what professional analysts do in an intelligence and political risk context, and how their work can feed into the conduct of international relations and international business.

This class focuses on the commissioning of large-scale representational architecture, the creation of public space, and the orchestration of streets at seven sites in continuous use since antiquity. By charting the chronological development of these sites, the class examines the ongoing dialogue between the past and present in Rome. Requirements include critical essays, presentations, and tests. Completion of this class qualifies as a prerequisite for Roma in Situ (ARTH 248), taught during January in Rome and in the Spring at Bard.

The course emphasizes how the study of antiquity gave birth both to archaeology (the study of the material remains of the past) and to art/architectural theory (the formulation of ideas for the future), while the study of anatomy and nature produced a new visual vocabulary. Beginning with Giotto, the class analyzes the contributions of Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Donatello, Pierodella Francesca, Fra Angelico, Alberti, Botticelli, Sangallo, Mantegna, and Bellini. In addition to secondary scholarship, readings incorporate primary sources by Ghiberti, Piero, Alberti, and Vasari. Requirements include a mid-term, a final, a critical essay, and a research paper on a work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Open to all students.

Indeed, one does not look into minimalist work as one does with a picture but rather moves around it. In addition to studying the work and writings of key minimalist artists such Donald Judd and Carl Andre, who are included in the collections of the Hessel Museum of Art, the course will also examine the Dwan Gallery archives, which are located at Center for Curatorial Studies. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Dwan was one of the key galleries showing Minimalist and Land Art in America. In addition to Bard\u2019s resources, the course will also make use of other local sites, such as Dia: Beacon. The course will conclude by examining Minimalism's various afterlives.

Largely the time period covered will be from the late fifties to the early seventies when there were a number of dynamic experiments in narrative, but we will also look at relatively contemporary work as well, including films by Bard faculty members. Films to be studied include those by Shirley Clarke, Michael Roemer, Adolfas Mekas, Curtis Harrington, Monte Hellman, Robert Frank, Yvonne Rainer, Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, David Lynch, Richard Linklater, Susan Seidelman, Jim Jarmusch and others.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Asian Studies In this seminar, we will look closely at the work of Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, whose subtly nuanced films are remarkable for their formal sophistication and their precise observation of everyday experience. By fusing multiple forms of artistic tradition with a uniquely cinematic approach to space and time, Hou has produced a body of work that, through its stylistic originality and historical gravity, opens up new possibilities for the medium. Special attention will be paid to Hou\u2019s treatment of history, to questions of film style, and to the relationship between his work and that of other filmmakers. The course is synchronized with an international retrospective coordinated through the Center for Moving Image Arts, and we will study all of Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s films as well as works by directors such as Edward Yang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yimou, Jia Zhangke, Yasujiro Ozu, Hirokazu Koreeda, Robert Bresson, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Olivier Assayas. Grades based on in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and a final research essay. Upper-college students who have taken courses in film criticism and history will have priority.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

Writers like Albert Murry, Ralph Ellison, Eudora Welty. There is an attempt in their works to illuminate the significance of the musical potential the musicians inherit and the creative option they exercise.

In this course, we will read and listen to examples of musical exoticisms from around the globe, exploring the connections between stereotype, sound, and the (post-) colonial condition. From Herder\u2019s idealized \"folk\" to Malinowski\u2019s \"natives,\" from the ritual songs of Omaha Native Americans to Stravinsky\u2019s neo-primitivist ballets, from \"pygmy pop\" to the Eurovision Song Context, our class will trace how stereotypes of exoticism have appeared in a variety of musical traditions from the 18th century to the modern day.Modern political discourses of indigeneity seek to challenge and undo histories of \"otherness,\" yet indigenes must often struggle against the paradox of appearing \"inauthentic\" when they try to make a living from creative enterprises. We will explore this conundrum through classic texts on the anthropology of music, more recent works on postcolonialism and music, situating accounts of musical exoticism into the broader context of European imperialism. Along the way, we will listen to a wide variety of musics, exploring the logics of musical systems that were once labeled as \"primitive.\"Students will generate weekly discussion questions based on reading and listening assignments that will be posted online in advance of class meetings. There will be in-class midterm and final exams, and a variety of brief writing exercises in a range of informal and formal styles. Every week, selected students will be required to bring in an \"object\" to discuss in class, offering a brief presentation that explains the relevance of the object to our course\u2019s theme.

Bach, the \"genius\" composer famous to our society, was in his own lifetime considered a far different musician, one not as admired (or even recognized) as we might assume. This seminar delves into Bach's life, his sizable musical family, and his creative influences. Some of his most revered compositions are analyzed and compared to other repertoire from the 17th and 18t h centuries. In addition, the course highlights landmark performances that served to promote Bach\u2019s greatness in following generations. Through the work of notable musicians \u2013 including Mendelssohn, Brahms, Albert Schweitzer, Stravinsky, Casals, Glenn Gould, Wendy Carlos, and John Eliot Gardiner-- the answer to \"Who was Bach?\" is seen to transform alongside the changing ideals of modern Western culture. Grades are determined through weekly reading and listening assignments, an exam, and a final project in which class members build an online Bach performance and research archive.

Starting with the \"Archduke\" Trio, this course will go through Beethoven's music of 1811 to 1827, his late period, with primary attention to how he increasingly molded all movements of a multi-movement form from a single idea, and also how he managed to overlay genres such as sonata form, variations, and fugue into a single movement, in a synthesizing apotheosis of classical form that no successor ever followed up on. In addition, we will also consider his minor works of the period- canons, folk song arrangements, marches- to gain a fuller view of what constituted a composer's daily life in the 1820s. The course is intended to satisfy a theory requirement for music majors, but might instead be used for a music history requirement if the student 's midterm and final papers take that approach.

And yet, beneath the surface it was also an era of unprecedented intricacy of structure and musical systematization. The liberation of dissonance and dissolution of melody left composers insecure, and they often compensated by creating systems of tremendous rigor not always apparent to the listener. This course will analyze in depth several works that changed the way we think about composing, and which pioneered the growth of an atonal musical language. Explore the cinematographic intercutting of Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps; the tonal axis system of Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion; the elegant number structures of Messiaen's\nQuartet for the End of Time; the delicate symmetries of Webern's Symphonie Op. 21; the total organization of Stockhausen's Gruppen; the fanatical precision of Babbitt's Post-Partitions; and the compelling multi tempo climaxes of Nancarrow's Study No. 36.

The process is one of learning how to put one's musical soul onto the page, pass that page first to players in the class and then eventually to professionals(the Da Capo Players) who give a concert of some of that music at the end of each semester. All along the way, the hope is that the music will \"come back\" to thecomposer as he or she had intended it to with some kind of profile and excitement.

Working in a spectrum from miniature to the scale of architecture and landscape, students will make a series of sculptural projects that challenge and shift our perception of what is big, and what is small, what is at the center, and what is at the margin, in our physical environment. The sculptural work of the class will be complemented with a series of readings, powerpoint presentations, and discussions that investigate the manipulation of scale and perception by sculptors throughout history.

We will begin with processes of envisioning structures and infrastructures through imaginary design, unconstrained by practical considerations. Studio projects will evolve from drawing and introductory modeling, ending in developed site-transformation concepts: The course will lead to proposals of practical and/or fantastical architectures at intersections of art and design. Students will research various sites, considering models that link the identity of place to its origins, and alternatively anticipating transitions into new, visionary modes of design through adaptation and intervention. We will examine a wide array of past and living examples through the presentation of projects, text, screenings and other materials. Students will develop their own plans individually and collaboratively, and will be encouraged to depart from traditional approaches to design to work from personal directives, improvisation and utopian vision. Weekly projects will lead to a developed proposal for situating your program in a specific site; research can include a range of materials; found (historic, inspirational) images, text, original drawings, diagrams, objects, maps, models and other relevant artifacts.

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves.

In this level 2 Sculpture class, students will use the UBS Red Hook Barn Studio to work on projects that take up space. In the first half of the semester, we will look at work from this show and examine some of the ideas that these Process/Materials artists used forty years ago. This will in turn lead us to think about ways of working that are specific to the time that we are living in now. In the second half of the semester, we will turn from this historical approach in order to work on something more timeless, but no less space-consuming: a mini golf course, in which each student will design, construct (and play) one hole. One of the goals will be to draw on what was learned in the first half and apply it to this large second half project. Requirement: Sculpture 1 or by permission of the instructor. Class size: 14",

        "description": "Facts: for the first half of the semester, students will use drawing as a form of research. Out of this research will emerge many notes, sketches and plans, done in various mediums, sizes, styles and approaches. The goal will be for each student to start a collection of images for future work. As the semester progresses, students will begin to make more complex work. They will start to imagine where this research could lead them. Fictions: for the second half of the semester, students will begin to translate their works into larger, more complex pieces. There will also be opportunities for various forms of collaboration. The final project will focus on the process of transformation. For example, the work might get bigger, turning into a construction of many elements. But they could also move in another direction, towards a deconstruction or even something more simplified and abstract. Requirement: Drawing 2 or Painting 2, or by permission of the instructor.

This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance.

Between the early nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, political revolutions and social upheavals challenged deep-seated assumptions about history, society, and the private life. Modern playwrights, in turn, began to alter the molecular makeup of drama, unraveling traditional modes of understanding narrative, illusion, and character, and writing plays that could respond to\u2014and create\u2014a modern world. This course will survey modern European and American drama, examining questions of realism and symbolism; the writing and staging of revolution and social history; subjectivity, illusion, and anti-theatricality. Playwrights under discussion will include B\u00fcchner, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Stein, Wilder, Williams, Genet, Brecht, and Beckett. Students will write a midterm and a final essay, and make an in-class presentation linking works of modern drama to developments in the visual arts, film, or social and political life.

By identifying, isolating, amplifying, and re-configuring their essential characteristics, we will aim to give these icons unanticipated performance life through a unified combination of visuals, text, movement, video and sound. This process will begin with a research phase, with group viewing and discussion of performance documentation, imagery, and writing by performers, artists, creators, and filmmakers who have found inspiration articulating character from specific sources, including the Wooster Group, Charles Ludlam, James Franco, Isaac Julien, Kazuo Ohno, and Eleanor Antin, followed by group discussions of this material.

Students will learn technical skills in object manipulation on their feet and in their body. They will work with structured improvisation in class. Presentations of applied principles will be prepared outside of class to be performed/critiqued. This course fulfills a Creative Practice requirement in Theater & Performance. Class size: 15",

Is civic duty to be preferred to individual love, as Virgil is usually read as suggesting? Is the straight path of epic to be chosen over the wandering itinerary of romance? Are the transcendent truths of Empire and Church to be pursued over the immediate experiences of private life? Medieval literature, with its idealization of courtly ladies and knights errant, is often seen as taking the side of Dido, while Renaissance literature, with its self-conscious return to antique ideals, is usually said to champion Aeneas. With this framework in mind, we will read St. Augustine's Confessions, troubadour lyrics, Dante's Inferno, the Arthurian romance Lancelot of the Lake, Petrarch's Canzoniere, and Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered.

Against this background, our main interest in the first half of the semester is love poetry and religious poetry including Jonson, Donne, Herbert, Traherne, Vaughan and Milton.

Our focus will be on the rich and fertile complexity, as well as the problematic features of Puritan belief and rhetoric as they find expression in Puritan writings.

What was ancient comedy, and how did it evolve? What was its legacy, and how do its concerns relate to the role played by comedy in our lives today? With mythical heroes, wily slaves, and singing frogs as our guides, we will travel to Athens and Rome by way of Hades and Cloudcuckooland to explore how the ancient comic theater played the part of carnivalesque ritual, penetrating political and social satire, or utopian fantasy. We will trace comic traditions from Aristophanes\u2019 theater of the absurd, through the social dramas of Menander, to the metatheater of the Roman playwrights Plautus and Terence. By reading a selection of plays in light of their ancient and modern performance contexts, we will explore the shifting boundaries between ancient and modern notions of theatricality, genre, humor, society, and the self. Readings, all in English translation, will include: Aristophanes, Frogs, Birds, Lysistrata; Menander, The Grouch; Plautus, The Braggart Soldier, Menaechmi; Terence, The Brothers.

It is often asserted that nature is ubiquitous in Japanese literary expression, but how and why did this come to be? How has nature been narrated, harnessed and reimagined at varying moments and locations, and how have the values assigned to it been deployed in the construction of national identity and in the processes of modernity? Exploring the tensions in the environment as an object of aesthetic appreciation as well as a potentially destructive force, our examination will also extend to varying political, social, religious, and ethical dimensions of the human responses to the lived environment, including what the natural environment and disasters can teach us. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, we will also be asking how attentions and concerns about environment have been raised and redirected, and will explore the emerging literary responses that have sought to grapple with life in an entirely changed landscape. Readings include a variety of fictional and nonfictional texts from the eighth century to the present, including classical court poetry, Matsuo Basho, Miyazawa Kenji, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Kawakami Hiromi, ecofeminist critics, Okinawan poetry, and an Ainu memoir.

From literary modernism to pragmatism to post-structuralism to personal computing, the interpretation and imagination of \"Asia\" and its traditions, art, and literature has played a key role in the evolution of Western aesthetic movements. Likewise, meetings between Asian, American, and European writers, artists, and thinkers have served to mediate the experience and shape of modernity in the East. Although many of these movements could be characterized as \"exoticist\" or \"Orientalist,\" this class aims to take seriously the ways in which the representation and mutual mis-representation of the East in the West has structured modern and contemporary ideas of language, visuality, space, and self. Readings include Okakura, Fenollosa, Waley, Pound, Kuki, Heidegger, Suzuki, Snyder, Chao, Buck, and Barthes, among others.

What does it mean for poetry to be a kind of \"making\"\u2014what materials does poetry use, and what logic does it follow? What makes a love poem successful?

        "description": "All tragedies see the human condition as doomed; but in classical Greek tragedy the protagonist's fate, usually signified by an oracle, is externalized as something beyond human control, whereas in modern tragedy, starting with Shakespeare and his contemporaries, fate is more or less internalized as a flaw in the protagonist's character. Since then the modern protagonist has increasingly been seen as a helpless victim of circumstance, a scapegoat. Fate is sometimes externalized as history, war, or society, sometimes internalized, but in either case the protagonist has been reduced in stature, so that 20th century tragedy can only be called ironic--a far cry from the heroic tragedy of ancient Greece. In tracing this complex history, including the disappearance and revival of the chorus, we will examine tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky (his novel Crime and Punishment), Ibsen, Strindberg, O'Neill, Brecht, Sartre, and Miller, all of which will be scrutinized in the light of major theories by Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and others.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies American poetry found its own voice in the first half of the 19th century when Emerson challenged American \"scholars\" to free themselves from tradition. For the next three generations most of the major poets, from Walt Whitman to Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens, acknowledged Emerson as a crucial inspiration. Emerson himself and two of his contemporaries, Longfellow and Edgar Allan Poe, were the first to achieve international fame, but it was in Whitman's poems that a distinctively American voice was first heard--a voice that was both oracular and plain-spoken. At the same time, the oddly metered, introspective poems of Emily Dickinson, mostly unpublished during her lifetime, spoke in a New England voice that was no less distinctive and no less American. Then, only thirty years after her death, the powerful modern voices of T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Ezra Pound, H.D., Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Robinson Jeffers, E.E. Cummings, and Hart Crane began to be heard. We will read selective poems by each of these, and we will also give equal time to Frost, the great contrarian poet who was dismissed by some as anti-modern but is now acknowledged as one of the greatest.

This course will offer a survey of the modern Egyptian novel, a survey that simultaneously maps the changing cityscape of Egypt\u2019s bulging metropolis, allowing for an examination of the developments and transformations of both during the course of the 20th century. Once considered the center of the Arab world, Cairo has witnessed repeated shifts in its regional and global position and importance over the last century. However, it continues to play a lead role in much of Egyptian literary (and cultural) production. From Naguib Mahfouz\u2019s iconic alley to Sonallah Ibrahim\u2019s apartment building, to HamdiAbu Golayyel\u2019s multifamily tenement, students will engage with novels that demonstrate a vast range of literary representations by Cairo\u2019s writers, from its shifting centers, to its ever expanding margins. Through close readings of these texts, we will consider the socioeconomic and political conditions that have impacted and radically restructured the city during its recent history, and the ways in which such changes are manifested in its novelists\u2019 stylistic and aesthetic choices. Literary texts will be supplemented by theoretical and historical material. This course will be accompanied by a film series. Taught in English. Class size: 22",

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "This course offers a critical introduction to the literature produced in Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars. The term traditionally used to categorize this literature, \"romantic,\" is interestingly problematic: throughout the course we will question the assumptions built into this term instead of assuming that we know what it means or taking for granted a series of supposed characteristics of \"romantic\" literature and art. We will also explore the extent to which key conflicts in British culture during the \"romantic period,\" including the founding of the United States, independence movements in the Americas, the development of free trade ideology, and the debates over slavery and colonialism, are still at issue today. The centerpiece of this course is the close reading of poetry. There will also be a strong emphasis on the historical and social contexts of the works we are reading, and on the specific ways in which historical forces and social changes shape and are at times shaped by the formal features of literary texts. The question of whether \"romantic\" writing represents an active engagement with or an escapist idealization of the important historical developments in this period will be a continuous focus. Readings include canonical and non-canonical authors: William Blake, William Wordsworth, Helen Maria Williams, Thomas Beddoes, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, John Clare, and Laetitia Elizabeth Landon.

Topics will include psychoanalysis and childhood subjectivity, empire, primitivism, gender performativity, Afrofuturism, post-9/11 paranoia, and the military-entertainment complex. We will read texts by authors including Suzanne Collins, Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin, C.S. Lewis, Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu, Tamora Pierce, Philip Pullman, J.R.R. Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Irish & Celtic StudiesThroughout the 20th century, Ireland and its \"Troubles\" represented what many believed to be one of the most intractable and seemingly irresolvable cases of hatred and conflict in the world. Violence and internecine warfare had often characterized its 800 year relationship with Britain. Sectarian hatred between Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as conflicts within these groups, and the cultural and political divisions between North and South, were entrenched. Constitutional politicians battled with paramilitary groups to define a complex discourse based on ancient enmity. Terrorism and violence to a large extent shaped the rest of the world's perception of Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland--a view complicated by the perspectives of a global Irish diaspora formed in the wake of centuries of immigration. In this course, we will explore the historical roots and cultural imagination of this long-standing strain of hatred and attempts to move beyond it in Ireland. Iconic events--the Easter Rising, a war of independence and the violence of the Black and Tans, civil war, Bloody Sunday, hunger strikes at Long Kesh (Maze Prison)--combined with the enduring trope of \"blood sacrifice\" to shape this cultural imaginary. How have works of art (poetry, plays, song, film) and popular culture (Gaelic games, the \"Orange\" marches) served to stimulate and define hatred as well as to overcome the human drive toward aggression and hostility? How did History figure into the cultural production of 20th century Irish Nationalists and Republicans, Unionists and Loyalists? From the standpoint of history, how did these myths obscure other realities now available to us? Careful study of speeches, memoir, and political documents will allow us to examine the functioning of \"languages of hatred\" as well as the movement to lay to rest and move beyond such languages after the Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement of 1998 and its implementation in 2007. In many ways, the course will culminate in this recent history of conflict: a deep study of the Good Friday negotiations reveals not the triumph of love over hatred, but rather a story of how an agreement is thrashed out by those who hate each other, followed by the story of its implementation and how to make such an agreement work in practice. We will examine the importance of culture in changing political life even as we recognize the persistence of affective memory in present-day Northern Ireland. What does it mean to live in a \"post-hatred\" environment? Does hate ever really go away? Class size: 22",

Authors include Benjamin, Kittler, Virilio, McLuhan, Azoulay, Lovink, Haraway, Ronell, and others.

It was a time when barriers of all sorts began to crumble\u2014barriers between past and present, foreground and background, high and low culture, beauty and ugliness, good and evil. Artists and writers responded in many different ways across the world. The writers we will read in this class represent the fulcrum of creativity in America, Central or Eastern Europe and Russia. Each lived at a different axis of modernity\u2014where East met West, where the Russian Revolution provided a vibrant but terrifying image of liberation, where modern technological innovation produced endless possibilities of satirization of both the old world and the new, where ethnic and genocidal violence was developing under the surface of this innovation into the foreseeable European Holocaust. These writers have something powerful and unique to say about the advent of the modern period in the fantastic parallel worlds they created where machines take on lives of their own, grotesque transformations violate the laws of science, and inversions of normality become the norm. Through their fantastic conceptions a vision of modernity emerges which questions the most basic presumptions of western civilization\u2014in art, morality, politics, the psyche and social life\u2014a vision for which the West still has no satisfying response. All readings are in English. We will read The Marvelous Land of Oz (L.

For instance, knowing how limited the prospects of early modern European women were, even aristocrats, creates new admiration for Shakespeare\u2019s bold and quirky comic heroines. Our primary focus is literary, but we will draw on critical readings, theater history, film and performance work. Plays to be read include A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, 1 Henry IV, As You Like It, Hamlet, Othello, and The Tempest. Open to all students. This course counts as pre-1800 offering.

And what can this effort to represent injustice, suffering, or resistance tell us about about fiction and literature? This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch ; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday; Wolves of the Crescent Moon by Yousef Al-Mohaimeed, and Bound to Violence by Yambo\nOuleguem. We will also watch a number of films based on the novels (including Chronicles, Smilla's Sense, Balzac, Snow Falling), and The First Grader (2001, on the right to education in Kenya). ",

These writers address the changes and social upheavals occurring in the subcontinent, much of which may be traced to the Partition of India in 1947. We will find that not only do these works of fiction confront the political, social and cultural issues and upheavals of the century with exemplary sophistication, but they also conjure up a subcontinent that is real, fantastical and with magical qualities. Other readings may include The Case of the Exploding Mangoes by Mohamed Hanif, The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai, Moth Smoke by Mohsin Hamid, and So, Tokyo Cancelled by Rana Das Gupta.

Norton and Co. \u2013 an arbiter of the canon in English \u2013 issued a two-volume Anthology of Literature by Women. Among other things, this publication provokes the knee-jerk question, is there a companion Norton Anthology of Literature by Men? (There is not.) The sheer existence of such a collection also throws into relief other, more pressing questions, though: for instance, who is the intended audience and what is their presumed taste in books? Is literature by women so extricable from its larger contexts, so separable from its various contents that authorial gender suffices as a uniting rubric? What is women\u2019s writing? And, for that matter, what is men\u2019s writing? Do these categories of gender and taste hold for today\u2019s audiences? Did they ever? Such questions are especially relevant to our present moment in which categories of gender and identity are being overwritten and expanded both colloquially and legally. In this course, we\u2019ll consider literary notions of gender and identity that alternatively reflect and distort our world, and we\u2019ll explore how gender is defined, catered to, and productively complicated through readings that will include some of the earliest texts written by women; early examples of the \"advice\" genre (including texts that offer solicited and unsolicited advice to everyone from female monarchs to anchoresses); and texts in which male authors ventriloquize women, and vice versa.

        "description": "Over the past several decades the critical boundaries between literary novels and genre fiction have become\u2014as the result of ambitious work by various innovative, pioneering writers\u2014increasingly ambiguous. The earliest gothicists framed their tales within the metaphoric scapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic grottoes, chthonic settings populated by protagonists whose inverted psyches led them to test the edges of propriety and sanity. Masters such as Angela Carter, William Gaddis, and Cormac McCarthy, while embracing this same fundamentally dark artistic vision, have radically reinvented and contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative arcs to create a new phase in this historic tradition. This movement, identified as the New Gothic, appears to have risen in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, which for the purposes of this course is termed New Wave Fabulism, whose achievement is to have taken the genre of fantasy/horror in a similar literary direction. While not breaking allegiance with the fundamental spirit that animates its genre counterparts, writers such as John Crowley, Kelly Link, and Elizabeth Hand are creating a body of serious literary fiction that deserves critical examination. Among others we will read are Robert Coover, Brian Evenson, Karen Russell, and Peter Straub. One or two authors will join us in class to discuss their work with students and give a reading.

Attention is mainly on the student's own production, and in the individual\u2019s awareness of what sorts of activities, rhythms, and tellings are possible in poetry, and how poets go about learning from their own work. The central work of the course is the student's own writing, along with the articulation, both private and shared, of response to it. Readings will be undertaken in contemporary and traditional poets, according to the needs of the group, toward the development of familiarity with poetic form, poetic movement, and poetic energy. Attendance at various evening poetry readings and lectures is required. Class size: 12",

In this course we will examine, from the ground up, the elements of that architecture by asking what, in the most concrete terms, makes a poem a dynamic, saturated language event. Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, we\u2019ll consider it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way we\u2019ll encounter such aspects of poetic form as: patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants will explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment. Writing for the course will take the form of creative responses to a wide variety of reading and weekly \"experiments.\" Class size: 13",

This course will also involve working on our own writing as much as the reading and discussion of published works. Writing assignments will be in dialogue with the pieces we read, and while this is nominally a nonfiction workshop, the pieces you write in this class will be perfectly free, perhaps even encouraged, to tread the nebulous borderlands between fiction and nonfiction.

Words do not resemble things, and so writers must find ways to conjure material presences in the mind\u2019s eye. Beginning with the grapheme and glyph, we will examine figures such as image, metaphor, simili and metonymy; ideas of description and depiction, mimesis and ekphrasis, and the complex relation between verbal particulars and abstraction. We will ask questions about the difference between a blank page and a screen, and contemplate the ways in which the digital age has altered our sense of near and far, the tactile and the corporeal; how the emphasis on visual information alters our relation to memory and knowledge. We will consider the possible connection between the aesthetics of visuality and the Western bourgeois culture of desire.

In this manner an ongoing conversation can begin to take place: one that can extend well beyond graduation from Bard. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the mechanics of literary community building, from submitting, interning, blogging, tweeting (one recent editor of the Paris Review Daily maintains a twitter feed about all things Pym), forming literary chat rooms and real life book clubs. We will consider strategies for sustainable engagement with the reading and writing students have cherished at Bard, extending into their twenties and far beyond. The professor will come for intense sessions (two days in a row) three times during the semester. The weeks in between, the class will meet and Skype with the professor.

In view of this dialogue between pre-modern and modern culture, this course eschews a chronological coverage of Chinese literature and culture that proceeds from one dynasty or time period to the next. Instead, it will focus on touchstone texts from pre-modern literary Chinese traditions, and then attend to how this cultural legacy is drawn upon, appropriated, and re-invented in contemporary cinema. Canonical texts include poetry, historical writings, and fictional narratives. We will focus on films made by some of the most influential directors including Wong Kar-wai, Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou, Jia Zhangke, and Lu Chuan. In every unit, we examine contemporary films alongside classical texts, guided by critical inquiries that look at how reading practices structure interpretation, how myths are framed, and how personal and cultural memory works. For example, we begin with Sima Qian\u2019s (2nd c. BCE) seminal historical narratives and biographies on the founding of the first Chinese empires, and then turn to two contemporary films\u2014Zhang Yimou\u2019s Hero (2002) and Lu Chuan\u2019s King\u2019s Feast (2012)\u2014to consider how they transform the earlier materials, retell the imperial past, and work as commentaries on the present-day Chinese state.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature, History In the fifth century BCE, Athens dramatically developed from a small, relatively unimportant city-state into a dominant power in the Aegean basin. Athenian political, artistic, literary, and intellectual traditions continue to reverberate through the world today: democracy, tragedy and comedy, rhetoric, philosophy, history, as well as the classical style of sculpture and architecture stem from this remarkable culture. The course will confront some of the ambiguities and tensions (slavery, exclusion of women and non-citizens from political power), as well as the glories, of Athenian art, literature, and history during this period. This course is designed primarily for first-year students. Class size: 22",

        "department": "classic",
        "description": "Linguists and archaeologists have a rough agreement that there existed a people speaking a language called Proto-Indo-European (PIE), unattested itself but linguistically reconstructable from cognate features in a number of languages covering a geographical spread from Sanskrit to Old Irish. There is little consensus about that people\u2019s original homeland, or the timing or causes for its migrations as far as the Indus Valley at one extreme and Ireland at the other. What can be agreed upon most readily from the linguistic evidence of this band of Indo-European cultures is that they shared not merely a common language and social structures but also common literary genres, principally epic and lyric, in which there are signs of common metaphors and even meters. Hence it is possible (without adopting any one theory about PIE history) to compare passages from epics originating in oral traditions and later crystallized into such texts as the Mahabharata and Ramayana in India, the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greece, the Norse Elder Edda, and the Irish T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. We will read selections from these areas and try to isolate cognate features, on the level of rhythm, diction, tropes, religious and military practices, and narrative structures, and read some of the principal secondary literature of Indo-European comparatists. We will then further try to formulate what may have been distinctive about each epic tradition\u2019s evolution. All texts will be read in English, with occasional glances at metrical and linguistic features of the originals. Class size: 15",

The course considers major critical approaches (e.g., Freudian, Marxist, feminist) and conducts a contrastive analysis of creative adaptations (Disney, classical ballet, postmodern dance) and other fairy-tale traditions (Perrault, Straparola, Arabian Nights).

But recent years have witnessed the resurgence of compelling work by new Italian directors, especially in films about the cultural changes created in Italy by the major waves of immigration from Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe. This course will focus on engaging works of contemporary Italian cinema, with special attention given to such themes as immigration; politics and corruption; work and social conditions; family and society. Films include Il Divo (Sorrentino); Best of Youth (Giordana); I\u2019m not Afraid (Gabriele Salvatores). Course conducted in Italian. Class size: 18",

We will analyze in-depth some of the most representative songwriters who best perceived and filtered important social and cultural moments of Italian life, in the last sixty years. La \u2018canzone d\u2019autore\u2019 (engaged music) has contributed to intellectual, social and artistic engagement for a number of Italian generations addressing topics such as: religion, terrorism, racism, Mafia, etc. Through its specificity, this genre will provide an alternative mode of engagement and a critical understanding of the complex and conflicted Italian society from the Sixties to today. We will complement the study of the texts with interviews, videos, articles and other authentic material about the composers and the specific issues that songs refer to. Students are required to write on a regular basis and are expected to actively participate in class discussions. Conducted in Italian. Class size: 18",

Authors trapped in fiction are sometimes persecuted, and then killed by their characters; others feel terrified, and become invisible as they hide behind the lines they write. Lastly, some authors are dead (or said to be dead), and speak to us from their tombs. What are the changing ways in which the ghostly figure of the author returns to fiction? What does it mean to be an author? This course will reflect on the notion of authorship as it was originally redefined with the birth of modern novel in Golden Age Spain, and reshaped during Romanticism and contemporary times. What is the mysterious position from which the author speaks to us? With an emphasis on Spanish literature put in conversation with Latin American and Portuguese literatures, we will explore selected writings by Larra, Unamuno, Azor\u00edn, Machado de As\u00eds, Fernando Pessoa, Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Borges, Juan Goytisolo, Merino, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\nCubas, Bola\u00f1o, and Mu\u00f1oz Molina, among others.

        "description": "Cross-listed: LAIS \"America is an Essay,\" writes Germ\u00e1n Arciniegas in the vein of Michel de Montaigne\u2019s Essais (1580), in which the essay is conceived as a literary genre for reflection, hybrid experimentation and the formulation of ideas. Anticipating independence from Spain after a long colonial period, writers in the American hemisphere used the form of the essay to imagine what the possibilities of an emerging \"Latin America\" could be. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, issues of citizenship, nationhood, collective values and identity have been re-framed and rethought by a long line of thinkers, including: Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Andr\u00e9s Bello, Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, Esteban Echeverr\u00eda, Domingo F. Sarmiento, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez\nRetamar, Octavio Paz and Eduardo Galeano. Tropes and expectations emerging from Western Enlightenment and Modernity are mapped onto the foundations of Nationhood and Citizenship. This attempt to inscribe foundational models will be tried out and ripped apart in writing, as history and human experience force abstract conceptualizations of identity to be continually re-assessed locally. Theodor Adorno, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Mignolo, Julio Ramos and others will provide the theoretical framework to situate the genre of the Latin American essay within a broader discussion of this literary form.

We will explore the effects of climate change on the ecology of animals, plants, and microbes, including biodiversity and ecosystem function, but will also include discussion on how these biologically oriented questions relate to the interconnected issues of human society, politics, and the economy. In addition, we will focus on relevant physical topics including the astronomical basis for natural variation in climate (years to eons), basics of global weather (e.g. gyres and Hadley cells), glacial cycles and marine circulation. In the laboratory portion of the course students will analyze ice core data, and use a bevy of tools to predict changes in the timing of migration in birds and butterflies, and predict how climate change will affect the distribution and range of plant and animal species.

This course takes a modern approach to the study of genetics in which classical ideas about genotype, phenotype and inheritance are integrated into the modern molecular and genomic understanding of the processes involved in the generation of diversity. In addition to discussions of the molecular mechanisms involved in DNA replication, recombination, the generation and repair of mutations, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype, special consideration is given to our understanding of the processes involved in generating population-level variation in complex traits and how this understanding can help us identify the myriad genetic and non-genetic factors influencing these traits. The laboratory consists of a semester long project involving the genetic manipulation of a model organism\u2019s genome to address one or more topics in the course. . This is a writing intensive course. Regular short writing assignments will be required, along with two 10-page essays (see below). We will meet for weekly hour-long writing labs. General goals are to help with the development, composition, organization, and revision of analytical and exploratory prose; the use of evidence to support an argument; strategies of interpretation and analysis of texts. Students will be responsible for their mechanics of grammar and documentation. Prerequisite: One biology course at the 140 level or higher. Class size: 18",

Particular attention is given to such figures as James, Pavlov, Freud, Skinner and Asch, to mention just a few. Illumination will also come from a consideration of correspondence between and among pivotal individuals in the field. Critical analyses and integrations are juxtaposed with historical renderings. Upper college students likely will benefit from this course because they already possess the foundational knowledge necessary to draw comparisons and critically evaluate varying points of view.

        "description": "All species are a product of evolution and Homo sapiens is no exception. Nevertheless, the Darwinian revolution that transformed biology a long time ago is only now taking place for the study of humans. Evolutionary psychology is the scientific study of human nature, based on understanding the psychological adaptations that our ancestors evolved in prehistory to cope with the challenges of survival and reproduction. In this course, we will study cognitive and social development from an evolutionary perspective such as the evolution of thought or language. We will also explore how evolutionary theory can be applied to understanding of human preferences and behavior including but not limited to: mate preferences, mating strategies, kin relationships, cooperation, conflict, aggression and warfare. In addition to textbook, we will read research articles to discuss and critic research methods used to test evolutionary psychological hypotheses.

In this seminar, we will explore the ways in which large swaths of mental processes and behavior operate outside of conscious awareness. We will begin with the history of these ideas but place a special focus on the empirical research of the past 40 years. After reading work in cognitive psychology that introduces us to foundational concepts such as implicit learning, memory, and perception (i.e., subliminal perception), we will spend the bulk of our time engaging with how these processes unfold in our social worlds (e.g., attitudes, prejudices, emotions, goals, self-esteem, and relationships). We will conclude by considering the implications of this research for notions of free will and individual responsibility. Readings will draw from cognitive, social, and clinical psychology as well as neuroscience and philosophy. Prerequisites: 1.

It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project). We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, \u2018nature\u2019), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology\u2019s own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

This course will explore a range of different issues raised by these perspectives through readings theorizing the body, supplemented by comparative ethnographic studies of bodily knowledge and practice. We will view bodies as sites of negotiation and resistance and contextualize them within local and global political economies and systems of power. Topics will include the gendering of bodies and other culturally constructed markings of social class, race, age; decisions concerning fertility and reproduction; manipulation of bodily surfaces and forms to establish boundaries and identities through techniques such as tattooing, piercing, dieting, sculpting and cosmetic surgery; commodification and fragmentation of the body through the selling and transplantation of body parts; and the blurring of body/non-body and human/non-human boundaries under the impact of new technologies.

In what ways has violence become naturalized in the contemporary world? In this course, we will consider how acts of violence challenge and support modern ideas of humanity, raising important questions about what it means to be human today. These questions lie at the heart of anthropological thinking and also structure contemporary discussions of human rights. Anthropology\u2019s commitment to \"local culture\" and cultural diversity has meant that anthropologists often position themselves in critical opposition to \"universal values,\" which have been used to address various forms of violence in the contemporary world. The course will approach different forms of violence, including ethnic and communal conflicts, colonial education, torture and its individualizing effects, acts of terror and institutionalized fear, and rituals of bodily pain that mark individuals\u2019 inclusion or exclusion from a social group. The course is organized around three central concerns. First, we will discuss violence as a means of producing and consolidating social and political power, and exerting political control. Second, we will look at forms of violence that have generated questions about \"universal rights\" of humanity versus culturally specific practices, such as widow burning in India and female genital mutilation in postcolonial Africa. In these examples, we explore gendered dimensions in the experience of violence among perpetrators, victims, and survivors. Finally, we will look at the ways human rights institutions have sought to address the profundity of human suffering and pain, and ask in what ways have they succeeded and/or failed. Readings will range from theoretical texts, anthropological ethnographies, as well as popular representations of violence in the media and film. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & Int\u2019l Studies, Middle East Studies; Science, Technology & Society \"Culture\" has long been a key explanatory framework for scholars studying the modern Middle East. It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

What is the relationship between nuclear testing and climate change? How have nuclear disasters changed the meanings of biological risk, biosecurity and governmental uncertainty? Is there an affect particular to the nuclear age? How has citizenship been transformed in proximity to nuclear toxicity? Can nature be nuclear?

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

Though the true origins of money are likely lost in the 'mists' of time, we can learn a lot from studying the monetary systems in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamian empires, as well as from the monetization of colonial Africa and the monetary regimes in modern nation-states. The course will examine different monetary systems in modern market economies: including gold standard episodes, money in the American colonies, sovereign currency regimes, monetary unions as in the EU, local currency areas, and emerging phenomena like bitcoin and peer-to-peer payment systems. We will apply different theoretical perspectives to the study of money to explain the functioning of these different monetary systems and the policy space they afford nations for achieving specific policy objectives.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies Economics is the study of constrained choice. Most introductory textbooks begin by characterizing the processes and outcomes of complex markets involving exchanges of goods and money among millions of \"agents\" (households and firms), which are implicitly assumed to obey established social conventions and governmental directives. This course develops economic principles from the ground up through successive extensions of a simple intuitive model. We first explore the economizing behavior of a single individual, acting alone, who struggles to survive by employing available resources to produce food and shelter. From this \"Robinson Crusoe\" model we derive basic concepts such as income, wealth, and utility; opportunity cost; labor and wages; capital and interest; land and rent; risk, profit and loss; competition; and, uniting them all, the equimarginal principle of optimization. We then introduce cooperation and exchange among persons in order to analyze markets, prices, property, externalities, public goods, money and credit, and the economic functions of government. Throughout, the human economy is understood as embedded in local and global ecosystems. Thought experiments are supplemented with an historical survey of actual economies, from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural subsistence economies to contemporary industrial systems.

Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges?

Designed as an advanced continuation of Econ 229 (Introduction to Econometrics), this course provides a rigorous treatment of regression analysis. Topics include models and tests that deal with violations of classical assumptions, time series, panel data, structural models and limited dependent variables. In several research projects and assignments, students will use the econometric software STATA to analyze real world data. Prerequisite: Calculus I and Economics 229 or permission of instructor. A prior background in economics and statistics is assumed. Class size: 15",

        "department": "economics",
        "description": "This course couldn't be more timely. Since the 1980s, income inequality has increased dramatically and is now the highest on record. More and more income goes to capital and profits, not workers and labor. Since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1% -whose share is at an all-time high. Economists have only recently turned their attention to those facts and there is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, let alone the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This seminar presents a survey of the landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and tries to relate those issues. The course is half lecture, half discussion and involves data procurement and analysis. The course is also research-based, through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. We focus on the case of the United States and provide international comparisons. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Economics & Finance The seminar will contrast the academic analysis of financial economics with the coverage it receives in the newspapers and on the nightly newscast. The stories on the news are almost always connected with people, whether we observe them shouting bids in a trading floor or talking on two phones simultaneously. Financial markets are dominated by people behaving in many different ways. Yet traditional finance theories concentrate on efficient markets, predictable prices that are determined by the concepts of present value, rates of return and analysis and pricing of computable risks. Human behavior has neither a place in the theory nor a need to be studied. This prevailing view has recently been challenged by the new paradigm of behavioral finance that considers the many anomalies of \"rational\" behavior and \"efficiency\" of markets. The new paradigm concerns itself with economic decision-making and investor psychology, and specifically with questions relating to how and why people exhibit a mixture of rational and irrational behavior. The seminar will examine the influence of economic psychology in the decision-making process of various agents as well as in the market's dynamics. Several guest lecturers will also offer their informed views in the development of contemporary finance. Class size: 15",

The course traces the complex processes of conquest, empire building, and the creation of many diverse, complex, and dynamic communities, societies, and cultures from the convergence of Native, European, African, and Asian peoples. The course considers peoples in the Spanish and Portuguese Empires of North and South America in three centuries, from the late fifteenth to early nineteenth centuries, starting with the first native settlements and indigenous societies. These empires later transformed into places like California, Texas, and the US Southwest, and nations as diverse as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Using sources like codices, native language writings, and other readings and writings of men and women in Colonial Latin America, the class will reflect on the peoples, places, events, as well as beliefs, cultures, and conflicts of a world different from our own. The course allows for a consideration of the historical legacies of the colonial period in contemporary Latin America. No previous study of Latin American history is required for this course.

How, then, did it become an emerging world power by the early 20th century? Why did Japan\u2019s transformations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to the total war of the 1930s and 1940s? And why did the horrible destruction experienced after World War II ultimately result in rapid economic growth and renewed global importance for Japan after the 1950s? These questions provide the framework for our study of modern Japanese history. Throughout the course we will focus special attention on Japan\u2019s distinctive urban culture, the changing role of women in Japanese society, the re-invention of Japan\u2019s imperial institution, the domestic and international effects of Japanese imperialism, and the question of the United States\u2019 role in Japan\u2019s post-war reconstruction.

The geographic focus will be the towns, cities, and peasant communes of the Italian and German speaking regions of Europe, particularly the Italian peninsula, Holy Roman Empire, and Switzerland. Two apparently opposed developments will be at the center of our approach: first, the role of the autonomous peasant commune, particularly in Switzerland, as a model and spur for political forms such as democracy and anarchism; second, the development of modern capitalism and technology as they came to impinge on the traditional feudal and communal orders. The course will also address the historiography and politics -surrounding the \"invention\" of the Renaissance in the late nineteenth century, looking particularly at Burckhardt's relation with Ranke, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.

In a nuclear age, any misstep threatened to be fatal not only to the antagonists but possibly also to the entire human community. What caused this hostile confrontation to emerge from the World War II alliance? How did Soviet-American rivalry affect the international community? And why after more than fifty years did the dance end in peace rather than war? Traditionally historians have approached those questions from a national point of view. Their answers had political as well as academic implications. To blame the Soviet Union was to condemn Communism; to charge the United States was to find capitalism as the root cause of international tensions. In this course we try to reconsider the Cold War by simultaneously weighing both the American and Soviet perspective on events as they unfolded. We will look at Stalinism, McCarthyism, the nuclear arms race, the space race, the extension of the Cold War into the third world, the rise of American hegemony, Vietnam and Afghanistan, Star Wars, and the effort to reach strategic arms limitation agreements. Finally, we will challenge the claims of American conservative ideologues that the Reagan arms buildup \"won the cold war.\" Students will examine key documents of the Cold War era and prepare several papers on world areas or events that they chose to explore.

Our point of departure will be traditional areas of focus for scholars of gender and sexuality in China: footbinding, the cloistering of women, and the masculinization of public space; the transformations of Confucian age-sex hierarchies within the family; the women\u2019s rights movements of the early twentieth century; and the Chinese Communist revolution\u2019s ambivalent legacy for women in the People\u2019s Republic of China. By drawing on recent historical and anthropological literature, we will also analyze gender\u2019s functions in many other aspects of modern Chinese life. These topics will include constructions of masculinity and male identity during China\u2019s late imperial period (1368-1911), the role of gender categories in constructions of Han Chinese relations with both Inner Asian nomadic peoples and Euro-American imperialists, the gendering of citizenship and comradeship in twentieth century China, the impact of global capitalism on gender constructions and sexual relations in contemporary China, and the relation of China\u2019s women\u2019s movement to recent trends in Euro-American feminism and gender studies.

Is there something essential that links capitalism, even liberal democratic capitalism, to slavery? How have struggles against slavery and for freedom and rights, dealt with this connection? This course will investigate the development of this linkage, studying areas like the gender dynamics of early modern Atlantic slavery, the correlation between coercive political and economic authority, and the financial implications of abolition and emancipation. We will focus on North America and the Caribbean from the early 17th century articulation of slavery through the staggered emancipations of the 19th century. The campaign against the slave trade has been called the first international human rights movement \u2013 today does human rights discourse simply provide a human face for globalized capitalism, or offer an alternative vision to it? Questions of contemporary reparations, rising colonialism and markets of the nineteenth century, and the 'duty' of the Americas to Africa will also be considered. Readings will include foundational texts on capitalism and a variety of historical approaches to the problem of capitalism within slavery, from economic, cultural, and intellectual perspectives.

Why did so few stand against slavery? Is it possible to ever adequately represent the Holocaust? This introduction to the field of public history will look at the role that historians and other academics play in shaping the institutions and practice of public history and the relationship(s) among public history, American culture, and popular memory. It will also address the practical aspects of career opportunities and internships in this field such as curatorship, documentary film, archival work, historic preservation, and community building.

For some, it meant moral and spiritual rejuvenation. For most, it meant an opportunity to tap a natural warehouse of resources that could be turned into wealth. At no time have those two visions been compatible, despite the efforts of politicians, artists, and scientists to reconcile them. This course is about that struggle. It looks specifically at the United States from the colonial era until the early Twentieth Century--a period in which one of the world\u2019s most abundant wildernesses was largely transformed into an urbanized, industrial landscape. We will study the costs and consequences of that transformation while listening to the voices of those who proposed alternative visions.",

Through a mix of theoretical and historical texts, we will consider how print media have fostered the development of new political communities like the nation state, generated publics and counter-publics, both created and undermined cultural authority, enabled new dynamics of knowledge production, and facilitated development of new modes of reading and interiority. Our inquiry will be global in scope, encompassing not only the Gutenberg revolution in Europe but also the diverse forms of print culture and print capitalism that developed contemporaneously in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. Analysis of the recent rise of digital media will provide critical perspective for understanding how the materiality of the printed text and its circulation through space has affected its social, cultural, and political significance. Ten weeks of the course will be dedicated to shared readings and discussion. The remainder of the semester will focus on completion of individual research projects related to the core themes of the course.

Historians are perplexed because Africa\u2019s independence and decolonization were supposed to bring peace and prosperity, and henceforth scholarship reflected this desire and promise. This seminar challenges students to move beyond the rhetoric of political conflict in Africa that extends from realities of failed states and underdevelopment and instead understand these current struggles as crises of historiography. In short, what does a contemporary history of Africa look like with the concept of civil war? Course participants will seek to understand the ongoing conflict in Central African Republic and South Sudan within a larger historical context of civil war in post-independent Africa. Through shared readings and discussions, students will use primary and secondary sources to consider possible causes for civil unrest in Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone, the actors and interests involved, proposed resolutions, and their immediate and long-term effects. By tracing a historiography of civil war in African historical and political discourse and by analyzing possible methodological complications, students will grapple with how real world experiences and acts of violence translate into historical narratives, the very politics of historical revisionism. Students will be required to develop and carry out an independent research project of their choosing.",

After brief consideration of the origins of history as a formal academic discipline (separate from literature) in the 19th Century, and of the transition from political to social history in the mid-twentieth century, we also consider the shift from social history to the multiplicity of approaches that came out of the \"theory explosion\" between the 1960s and 1990s. This course draws from the fields of modern European, African and World History. The larger questions to keep in mind throughout the course are: What are the interpretive strategies used and debated by historians? What type of evidence does the author use? How does a historian work with both evidence and interpretive frameworks to produce historical writing?To get at some of these questions, the course draws largely (but not entirely) from historical writing about the Great War from a variety of historiographical points of view. Secondary School teaching of WWI tends to come from the diplomatic history approach, and to emphasize the war on the western front. To enlarge this view, we will read not only about the classic \"causes of WWI\" literature, but also from gender, cultural, and post-colonial treatments of the war. Working with this diversity of texts gives us opportunity explicitly to discuss how different historiographical approaches change how we understand \"what happened.\" Class size: 5",

Particular attention will be given to philosophical discussions of the standard of beauty, progress in the arts, the medium of an art, art\u2019s relationship to truth, art and the theatrical, and the antagonism of art and convention; throughout, these discussions will be brought to a consideration of the accomplishment of individual works of art.

Readings will include essays and selections from longer works by David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F.

Some background readings will provide a sketch of a diverse range of feminist theoretical frameworks -- liberal, socialist, radical, psychoanalytic, and postmodern -- with readings from Alison Jaggar, Simone de Beauvoir, Annie Leclerc, Christine Delphy, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Sarah Kofman, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous. We will then turn to an exploration of such issues as the cultural enforcement of both feminine and masculine gender identities, the mass-marketing of popular cultural images of sexuality, gender, and race, the urban environment and women's sense of space, the intersection of feminism and environmentalism, the logic of subjection governing cultural ideals of women's bodies (dieting, exercise, clothing, bodily comportment), issues of rape, sexual violence and harassment, pornography, and feminist perspectives of different ethnic groups. We will also screen a number of films and videos, including the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, Madonna's \"Truth or Dare,\" and documentaries on the pre-Stonewall femme-butch bar-scene culture of the 1950s and 60s, anorexia, rape on campus, the pornographic film industry, and several others.

So it is fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of being.\" With these words, Martin Heidegger signals both the task and the urgency ofBeing and Time(1927), one of the most important and difficult texts in the history of Philosophy. In this course we too will \"raise anew\" the question of being by engaging in a sustained close reading of Heidegger'sBeing and Time. Through our reading, we will grapple withHeidegger's phenomenological approach and attempt to work through central Heideggerian themes and concepts such as Dasein, Being-in-the-World, Being-with, Care, Thrownness, Anxiety, Temporality, Being-towards-Death, Resoluteness, and Authenticity. We will also read several of Heidegger's later essays and lectures. Prerequisites: a previous course in philosophy and permission of the instructor.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Indigent defendants are falsely convicted, and even executed for crimes they did not commit. We say that law is the institutional embodiment of justice. And yet, it is equally true that law, as it is practiced, seems to have little connection to justice. As the novelist William Gaddis writes: \"Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.\" This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty to obey the law? Is it possible for law to do justice? Through readings of legal cases as well as political, literary, and philosophical texts, we seek to understand the problem of administering justice as it emerges in the context of contemporary legal institutions. Texts will includeImmanuel Kant,Groundwork of a Metaphysic of Morals,Herman Melville,Billy Budd, andselections from Dostoevsky, Twain, Melville, Plato, Blackstone, Holmes, Milton, Kant, and others.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities (1 credit) In the last year, popular books like The Unwinding by George Packer and Coming Apart by Charles Murray have bemoaned the fading of the American Ideal. On the left, The Unwinding tells the tale of the demise of American institutions and the loss of American ideals as an inspiring dream. On the right, Coming Apart gives voice to the sense that America no longer exists as a single nation; Murray argues that Americans in wealthy zip codes have pitifully little in common with their countrymen in poor zip codes. These differences include not simply lifestyle, but also values and dreams. If Murray thinks Americans are increasingly living in fundamentally different worlds, Packer sees the once great American dream crumbling around us, consumed by corruption, consumption, and institutional failure. We confront today the weakening of our collective vision of freedom and equality. Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party manifest anger at the betrayal of American constitutional democracy, but with little awareness of a common heritage. Americans are dismayed at the power of money, the decay of self-governance, and a bureaucracy that seems impervious to popular control. And yet few dare to articulate a collective vision that might hold the country together. The 2014 Hannah Arendt Center Conference will ask: Are there common ideals left that we share as Americans? How can racial justice co-exist with American ideals? How can we save and reinvigorate American Dream? Can Americans build myths and institutions that nurture a common world? This 1 unit class will meet 5 times. At four meetings prior to the Arendt Center Conference on Oct. 9-10 we will read material by speakers at the conference, such as excerpts from Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Lawrence Lessig, Kendall Thomas, George Packer, Charles Murray, Joan Richardson, and Hannah Arendt. We will discuss as well John Ford\u2019s film \"The Searchers\" and George Cukor\u2019s \"Philadelphia Story.\" Students will attend the conference and have the opportunity to respond by creating humanistic essays in the medium of their choice. These may include blog posts, videos, digital maps, or other forms. There will be one post-conference meeting to discuss the conference and students will be able to present their work at the Experimental Humanities Share Event at the end of the semester.

This course unpacks the historical and ideological roots of that conflict, how it has developed over the course of the years, and what possibilities exist for its resolution in the future. The course is divided into three main sections. The first one covers the years between the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the events leading to World War II. It emphasizes U.S. attempts at creating a \"sphere of influence\" over Latin America, highlighted by numerous military interventions in places like Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, as well as Latin American responses to what they perceived to be an American project of imperialism. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War as played out throughout Latin America. It emphasizes the real and perceived fears by U.S. policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to interventions in Cuba, Chile, and Guatemala, among other nations, and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon the peoples of Latin America. The third and final section looks at the most salient issues in contemporary U.S-L.A. relations: economic integration, the illicit drug trade, and Latin American migration to the United States.

This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions. Interested students should email Prof. Baruah prior to registration (baruah@bard.edu) with a short statement of why they would like to take this class. Class size: 20",

This course will examine the different ways in which scholars of politics make use of data in constructing and supporting their arguments. To begin with we will consider to what extent any artificial replication of the world around us can be completely accurate \u2013 and what that means for our own study. Examining a variety of different approaches including regressions, game theory, discourse analysis, experimentation, and historical analysis, the course will consider the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and discuss examples of each. For students thinking about a senior project in political studies, this course will give the opportunity to think about how they will construct their own research project. Class size: 22",

While most characterizations of democracy see it as a form of government, this course explores the essence of democracy as a specifically modern way of life. To do so, it turns to some great thinkers of American democracy such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Ralph Ellison, W. E. B. DuBois, and Hannah Arendt. What unites these radical democrats is the conviction that democracy is a practice of individuals rather than an institutional form of governance. As an ideal of radical individualism, American democratic thought offers, perhaps surprisingly, an aristocratic critique of the limits of democratic government even as it, seen from another side, makes possible our culture of narcissistic consumerism. Our aim is to understand the democratic spirit of radical individualism that has proven so seductive and powerful since its modern birth in the American revolution. Texts will include Emerson\u2019s essays The American Scholar and Experience, Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man and Arendt\u2019s On Revolution. Class size: 15",

We begin by examining the assumptions we bring to the study of Buddhism as a \"religion\" and the circumstances of the initial Western encounter with Buddhist traditions. We then look at the Indian origins of Buddhism and its relationship to other Indian religious and philosophical traditions. In particular, we consider how Buddhism evolved in relation to other major developments in Indian culture such as the invention of writing and the rise of images as a form of religious expression. Next, we explore representations of the Buddha\u2019s birth and enlightenment in the art and texts of the early tradition. As we proceed to look at key aspects of the tradition, thinking about how Buddhism challenges existing ideals of self and identity will feature prominently in our discussions. While much of the course focuses upon the rise of Buddhism as an Indian religion, we will also consider how the tradition was reinvented in its spread to Southeast and East Asia and the Himalayas.

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram at Yale University demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study, including the pronounced ethical considerations and the necessary generalizability to societal and historical contexts cannot be over-stated. As recently as five years ago a replication of the original study with only slight modifications was published (J. Burger, January 2009) and more recent studies reveals that \"obedience\" is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well. Also the ethical debate and ecological validity controversy have not lessened. But aside from the volume of investigations the current domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest; this because of historical events in the intervening years since1960. The seminar will convey that the continuing study of obedience phenomena is vital for the betterment of institutions - even in a democratic society - and that social scientists must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and learn the rudiments of how it can be minimized. This is an upper college seminar. It is designed for moderated social studies majors and even those from other divisions of the college, who will require permission of the instructor to enroll. Criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share the results of such reading and study. (The title for this seminar is taken from the biography of Stanley Milgram authored by Thomas Blass, a professor of social psychology at the University of Maryland Baltimore County campus.

Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., prestige, income, occupation). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. education, intelligence, parental wealth, gender, race). Class size: 22",

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

The first part of the class introduces the concepts used by classical sociological theories to help us understand society and consider how sports function in society. We will also study some mainstream sociological theorists that have studied sports in detail. We will then move on to consider inequalities portrayed and reproduced in sport, related to gender, race and class. Other substantive research areas in the sociology of sport include roles of fans and athletes, politics of sport, nationalism and competition, globalization, media, and sport and the body.

As to the recent past, consider: first blacks gains since the Civil Rights era (political, economic, social \u2013 however incomplete); second, Hispanics and Asians transforming what it means to be non-white; and third, the virtual disappearance of earlier rigid divisions among Euro-American ethnics such as Irish, Italians, Jews and Slavs. We will explore the meaning of contemporary race, ethnicity and assimilation with these recent American patterns in mind. We will also spend a substantial part of the course on the growing efforts by thoughtful Americans, mostly social scientists, to think about the directions that these patterns of group life may take in the coming few decades. Topics include: social mobility and economic wellbeing, interracial marriage, political power, discrimination, the impact of immigration, group identity and culture, the expected racial transformation to a non-white American majority.

What role does technology play in our lives? Technology changes what we do - does it change who we are? We are living at a time of rapid technological innovation and diffusion and the above questions indicate that these new technologies are the cause of both much excitement and much concern. In this class students will learn to understand a variety of media technologies in their historical context and they will explore the impact that these technologies have had on social and political life. To this end, we need to think about technologies in a couple of different ways: (1) What does technology (print, radio, Twitter\u2026) enable us to do? (2) How does technology affect the way people think about themselves, their political situation and the social world? And what are the consequences of these changes? Students will become familiar with relevant concepts from political sociology including nationalism, the public sphere, social capital and social movements. We will also consider the downside of media technologies, and inequalities in terms of access and participation. Class size: 22",

Yet often lost in these debates\u2014in which positions are typically polarized between those who view globalization as a positive, inevitable force, and others who view it as destructive\u2014are a number of important intellectual and practical issues around which this course is organized. We will examine what is and is not unique about the contemporary era, and address how new forms of production and networking are transforming the role of the nation-state, affecting wealth distribution, and impacting the natural environment. This course will also look closely at how modern-day globalization has given rise to new forms of social conflict, political contestation, and struggles for change. Through projects conducted in the Hudson Valley and interdisciplinary academic study, this course will challenge students to think holistically about transnational processes and consider the fundamental question of what it means to be a citizen in this globalized world.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Anthropology, LAIS This class will demonstrate how the study of performance can be used as a model for the study of social life more broadly. Students will be introduced to the emerging discipline of Performance Studies which combines insights from the study of the theater and performing arts with sociological and anthropological work on ritual and community. We will examine how sociologists have used performance as an analytical model, from the work of Erving Goffman on the presentation of self in everyday life to Alexander\u2019s model of social performance. The seminar will be discussion and exercise based, with some films and lectures. Substantive topics that we will study using a performance lens include the performance of reconciliation in post-Apartheid South Africa, the mobilization of mothers in Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War\u2019, gender as a socially constructed performance, the use of performance in social movements, and the performance of political campaigns.

        "department": "sociology",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights This advanced seminar traces sociological approaches to the self and examines institutional and political attempts to govern social life by shaping the self. It engages questions about power relations; the construction of knowledge; subjectivity; and debates over agency and individualism. The class straddles political and cultural sociology and links the micro-level of everyday experience with macro-level questions of power and politics. It covers the symbolic interactionist tradition, including Mead and Goffman, and how sociology broke with Enlightenment ideas about the individual. We delve into qualitative and historical research on many contexts, including paid labor, the field of psychology, prisons, self-help groups, and reproductive policy. We also consider how social relations become embodied in us as ways of being in the world. The course looks closely at the \"governmentality\" scholarship associated with Foucault that examines how authorities think about and enact forms of regulation and control. The course will enable students to examine questions of identity and individuality, recent shifts toward \"neoliberal\" governance, and the politics of empowerment. Class size: 15",
